## 1. Configuring Multi-Use Products

### Introduction

Configuring simple Medication (ERX) records is one of the largest tasks associated with installing and maintaining Willow Inpatient. In this chapter, we’ll review Willow’s medication-related data structure and look at how to configure a specific type of medication: multi-use products (such as topical creams, inhalers, and eye drops).

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able to…

- Describe the purpose and importance of the Medication (ERX) master file
- Configure a simple Medication (ERX) record for a multi-use product with no discrete dose
- Configure a simple Medication (ERX) record for a dosed, multi-use product

### Review of Prior Concepts

In this exercise, you’ll review concepts from RX100 Willow IP Fundamentals.

#### Exercise 1: Medication (ERX) vs. Package (NDC) Records

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Ibuprofen|Hydrocortisone cream|100 EA bottle of Ibuprofen 200 mg tablets from Perrigo|
|1000 mL flex container of Dextrose 5% IV solution from Baxter|Ibuprofen tablets|Dextrose 5% IV solution|
|Ibuprofen 200 mg tablets|100 EA bottle|Hydrocortisone 2.5% cream|

Dextrose 5% IV solution, Ibuprofen 200 mg tablets, Hydrocortisone 2.5% cream

1. How did you choose your answers to #1? In other words, what is the definition of a **simple** **ERX** record?

Combination of drug, form, and strength

1. Find examples of a **Package (NDC)** record above and mark with “NDC”.

100 EA bottle of Ibuprofen 200 mg tablets from Perrigo, 1000 mL flex container of Dextrose 5% IV solution from Baxter, 30 g tube of hydrocortisone 2.5% cream from Fougera

1. How did you choose your answers to #3? In other words, what is the definition of a **Package (NDC)** record?

Combination of ERX (drug, form, and strength), package size and type, and manufacturer

1. Which of the following statements about the Medication (ERX) master file are TRUE? (Choose ALL that apply.)

A. Each hospital at your organization has its own database of ERX records

B. Every ERX record in your system needs to be configured

C. Most ERX records are initially created from third-party data

D. When you search for a new medication order, you’re searching for an ERX record

Answer: C and D

1. Which of the following statements about the Package (NDC) master file are TRUE? (Choose ALL that apply.)

A. Each hospital at your organization can use different NDCs for the same ERX

B. Most NDC records are initially created from third-party data

C. When you search for a new medication order, you’re searching for an NDC record

D. You can’t verify a medication order without an NDC

Answer: A, B, and D

1. Continue on to the next exercise if you have time.

#### If You Have Time: Navigating in Clinical Administration

1. Imagine that you have logged in to Text and navigated to the Medication master file prompt. You search for 'miconazole' and see the following. What should you do?   
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637921776917889516.png&ver=1656616891787)

A. Enter '1'  
B. Enter '3'  
C. Enter "T" for today's date

Enter 3 for the most current contact of the ERX record

1. The record opens and you realize it is the wrong record. Which of the following are ways to close the record? (Choose ALL that apply.)  
    A. **PAGE UP** once  
    B. Press **ENTER**  
    C. Press **SHIFT + F7**  
    D. Type "opt"  
    A and C will close the record. ENTER moves to the next field and typing 'opt' will override the text in the field your cursor is on.
2. No, wait! That was the right record. From the Medication prompt, how can you get back into the same record?  
    A. Type "="  
    B. Type "5039"  
    C. Type "mic nit 2 ex cre"  
    D. All of the above  
    All of the above! The fastest way is to type "=", but ID and name will also get you back to the record. 

### Medication (ERX) Record Basics

Recall that there is one shared medication (ERX) master file at your organization for all hospitals, pharmacies, clinics, etc. There are different types of medication (ERX) records:

- **Simple ERX record:** specific drug, form, and strength of a medication that is commercially available
- **Custom simple ERX record:** specific drug, form, and strength of a medication that is not commercially available, such as split tablets
- **Mixture record:** medication containing two or more components that must be compounded by the pharmacy
- **Orderable mapping record:** represents a single IV or drip to display in search results and maps to all possible products (or "dispensables") that correspond to that IV or drip
- **TPN record:** a liquid bag of nutritional components that contains components like amino acids, lipids, dextrose, vitamins, and minerals

Commercially available simple ERX records are generated by information imported into the system from a third-party vendor, however during this import, multiple records are actually generated: generic ERX record, Brand ERX records, and NDC records. During this import, all Brand ERX records (and in turn, all of the NDC records) are linked to the generic ERX record automatically.

Log in to Hyperspace as your Pharmacist user (RX##) and open Kristi's chart to the Orders activity.

Click **+New** and search for SSD (a Brand name of silver sulfadiazine). Choose the SSD 1 % EX CREA from the Database tab.

Select it and open the order composer. Which product will be dispensed? SILVER SULFADIAZINE 1 % EX CREA (a generic product)

Next to the Package field, click ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637922767022257657.png&ver=1656715902230) to see a list of NDCs.

- Woah! There are lots of packages to choose from, both generic and Brand. 
- Even though the generic ERX record is displayed while ordering, all NDCs are available.

|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|_What does "Brand" mean?_<br><br>- A drug sold by a drug company under a specific name or trademark and that is protected by a patent is referred to as a Brand name, or in some cases a Trade name. <br><br>_What if a generic version of a medication is not available yet, in other words, there are only Brand names commercially available?_ <br><br>- Even in this case, the third party still creates a generic ERX to use as the dispensable product. There just won't be any generic packages available for dispensing, only Brand names.|

#### The Dispensable Product

The generic ERX record is referred to as the _dispensable product._ Because Brand ERX records are linked to the dispensable product:

1. The dispensable product is the ERX record that is added to a Medication List (EFY).
2. The dispensable product is the ERX record that needs to be configured.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637922735841164728.png&ver=1656712784117)

Adding the dispensable product to a medication list:

When the dispensable product is added to a medication list, packages (NDCs) for the generic and Brand names can be marked as available for dispensing.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637956533683150822.png&ver=1660092568297)

Configuring the dispensable product:

Because all Brand ERX records are linked to the dispensable product, any configuration made in a Brand ERX record will NOT display to end-users. You should always configure the dispensable product.

**TRAINER DEMO**: Your Trainer will open the SSD 1% EX CREA [7013] record in Text, and point out the **Dispensable product** field on the first screen.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|_Why are there Brand name ERX records?_<br><br>- Although the generic ERX record is the one used for inpatient purposes, for ambulatory settings there are situations where a provider or patient would prefer to have a Brand name medication prescribed. To make this possible, Brand name ERX records are necessary. Little to no configuration is needed in these records, even for outpatient use.<br><br>_What about Brand name ERX records that aren't equivalent?_<br><br>- Certain medications with narrow therapeutic indexes may have a number of clinically non-interchangeable Brand name ERX records mapped to the same dispensable product. Medispan, the FDA Orange Book, and other third parties may consider these equivalent, but you may want to distinguish between them. To do this, use Equivalence Groups to classify which products are interchangeable and which are not. Learn more in the [Medications Setup and Support Guide](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=1001655&PrefDocID=98977) >> [Add Equivalence Groups to Separate Medications That Shouldn't Be Interchangeable](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=100192923&PrefDocID=98977). <br><br>_Do ERX records need to be configured for outpatient contexts, like prior-to-admission or discharge meds?_<br><br>- As you configure the dispensable product, you'll notice there are screens and fields for "Outpatient" or "Ambulatory." A lot of configuration for outpatient contexts is set at a system-level; in other cases, if the outpatient setting is left blank, the system uses the inpatient setting. Things you configure in an ERX record will override these settings. Learn more in the Medications Setup and Support Guide. If your organization is licensed for Willow Ambulatory, you can also refer to the [RXAMB400 Willow Ambulatory Administration](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=100056568&PrefDocID=127491) training companion.|

### Configuring a Non-Dosed Multi-Use Product

The majority of simple medication (ERX) records are generated by information imported into the system from a third-party vendor. These records contain information such as pharmaceutical and therapeutic classes, DEA schedule, and links to medication and allergen warnings. These records do NOT include things like: 

- Nice-looking names to appear in Hyperspace and Classic
- Dose, route, and frequency defaults and buttons
- Allowed dose units, routes, and frequencies

These details need to be configured in Clinical Administration in each medication (ERX) record. 

**TRAINER DEMO**: Your Trainer will order ERX record 7224 for Kristi and open the order composer.

- This medication is configured.

Search for "trn3## silver sulfadiazine", find it on the Database tab, and order it for Kristi.

- If you haven't already, log in to Hyperspace as your Pharmacist user and open Kristi's chart.
- This medication is not yet configured. This record is a copy of silver sulfadiazine basically as it would look when imported from the third party. 

Compare the top half of the order composer for your medication to your trainer's configured medication. What is different? 

There are many differences including the name on top of the order composer, the fields that appear, no buttons, few defaults, all dose units, routes, and frequencies. 

Click the magnifying glass in the Route field. Which routes are allowed for your trainer? For you? 

The trainer has only one allowed route, Topical. All routes are allowed for your record.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|During class, you will configure many ERX records that contain only the information that comes from the third party as you learn to navigate in Text and understand how items configured in Text appear to end users. The Foundation System has many ERX records pre-configured for use when you get ready to go live with Epic, which will be reviewed by the Willow project team to decrease the number of records that need to be configured "from scratch".|

#### Configuring Naming

There are two key names that need to be configured, the Order Name and the Order Display Name. In addition, configure synonyms to make a medication record easier to find. 

Leave the order in Kristi's chart in Hyperspace.

Log in to Text as your Admin user. (Hint: The initial password in Text is 'train', and you won't see it as you type.)

Follow this path to navigate to the Medication master file prompt: **Clin Admin >> Meds, Allergens, Imm, etc. >> Medications (ERX)**

Type "trn3## silv sulf" (replacing ## with your assigned number), press **ENTER**, and select the only contact.

The value in the **Name** field for simple ERX records is configured by the third party. It will not appear in many places, and doesn't need to be edited. The system can search against this name. Add other common names, abbreviations, or mnemonics as synonyms.

In **Synonyms**, enter: 

- SSD
- Silvadene
- SILV1
- Thermazene

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|_Does capitalization matter?_<br><br>This field is case sensitive, and when a user searches with a synonym, it will appear exactly as it does in the Synonyms field in parentheses after the search name. Some synonyms may be included with the third-party data, and are often all capital letters. You can typically leave these as-is, since they don't appear frequently to end users.  <br>![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637921832266869711.png&ver=1656622426687)|

##### The Order Name

The Order Name appears in many places throughout Hyperspace: the top of the Order Composer, on the MAR, on labels, etc. The system generates this by pulling together values from a few different items. The standard format for the Order Name in a configured medication is:

- _<generic name> (<Brand name>) <strength, if applicable> <form> <dose>_

Leave the ERX record open in Text and return to Hyperspace. Compare your non-configured Order Name to the trainer's configured one.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637956534224276696.png&ver=1660092622433)

To configure the Order Name, use these items in the ERX record:

- **Medication Short Name:** This field overrides the short name provided by the vendor. Enter the generic name in lowercase ﴾or TALLman format if it exists﴿.
- **Medication Brand Name:** Enter the brand name, first letter capitalized. The system will put parentheses around whatever you enter in this field.
- **Inpatient Order Name Suffix:** Use this field to represent the form of the drug in lowercase letters. It should describe the form in a way that meaningful to doctors and nurses.
- **Include Strength in Order Name?** If the strength of the medication is meaningful to end‐users, it should be included. Depending on the unit of strength from the vendor, this field may default to either yes or no.
- **Include Form in Order Name?** You should say “no” in this field. You are telling the system NOT to use the form that comes from the vendor. You already configured the form the way you want it in the Suffix field!

What about the dose? You do not need to configure anything for the dose! If there is a dose field, the dose will automatically be added to the end of the Order Name.

Remove this order from Kristi's chart in Hyperspace.

Return to Text. Page down 23 times to the Medication Order Name Text screen. (Hint: If your record is closed, use = to open it again.) 

Configure these items:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637956532055959708.png&ver=1660092405593)

Page down 1 time and configure these items:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637956532295652370.png&ver=1660092429550)

**TRAINER DEMO**: Your Trainer will leave **Include Form in Order Name** blank.

Close the record in Text. (Hint: **Shift + F7**)

- Changes in Text are saved as you move from item to item. Closing the record ensures that you will see those changes in Hyperspace and Classic. 

In Hyperspace, search for "trn3## ssd" and select it from the Database tab.

Review the Order Name on the top of the Order Composer.

- Does the name appear as expected? What is different about your trainer's Order Name? The word "cream" appears twice.
- Because your trainer included the form in the Order Name, both the form from the third party and the suffix are displaying!

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|Always enter “No” in the Include Form in Order Name field for any simple ERX record you configure. The form from the vendor is not always formatted well, so you should use the Order Name Suffix field to enter the preferred form.|

##### The Order Display Name

The Order Display Name appears to end users in search results from the Orders activity, and when a user favorites a medication to add it to their personal preference list. The system uses the value for one specific item for this name. The recommended format for display names is:

- _<generic name> (<Brand name>) <form> <strength if appropriate>_

Close the order composer and click the star to add this to a personal preference list. What appears in the Display Name field? 

- Nothing, it hasn't been configured!

Click **Cancel**. You do NOT want to add this to your personal preference list!

Click **+New** search for "trn3## ssd".

- On the Database tab, the name that is displaying is all capital letters.

**TRAINER DEMO**: Your Trainer will click **+New** and search for 7224.

- On the Database tab, the name is case sensitive and include TALLman lettering.

If the display name is not configured, the system will use the record name, which isn't always clear and doesn't look very nice. Configure the Order Display Name to improve this. The Order Display Name field is case sensitive and will appear in Hyperspace exactly as entered.

Remove this order for Kristi.

Return to Text and open your trn3## silver sulfadiazine. (Hint: "=")

Page down 21 times to the Inpatient Order Defaults screen. 

Configure the **Order Display Name**: trn3## silver sulfADIAZINE (Silvadene;SSD) cream 1 %

**TRAINER DEMO**: Your Trainer will close the record in Text. Then...

- Search for it in Hyperspace:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637956534727919469.png&ver=1660092672787)

- Accept it and click the star to add it to a personal preference list (then cancel):

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637956534941682067.png&ver=1660092694170)

- Now your trainer will remove the order and meet you back in Text on the Inpatient Order Defaults screen.

#### Configuring Display Items on the Order Composer

The fields that appear on the order composer, the display items, should match the needs of that medication. For example, many medications require a dose field (such as tablets, capsules, eye drops, IVs), but a bulk multi-use medication like silver sulfadiazine cream doesn't. 

Rather than define these fields in each record individually, link each simple ERX record to a record in the Order Composer Configuration ﴾OCC﴿ master file. OCC records control:

- **Display Items**: The fields with headers running down the left side of the Order Composer, like Dose, Route, and Frequency.
- **Item Control**: Which fields are required ﴾stop signs﴿, recommended ﴾yield signs﴿, or not required. Required fields must be filled in before an order can be signed.
- **Summary Items**: Items that make up the Summary Sentence ﴾the order details that appear under the Order Name in the Orders Sidebar and on the MAR﴿.

If a medication ﴾ERX﴿ record doesn’t have an OCC attached to it, the system will use the default OCC record ﴾“RX NON‐FORMULARY CONFIGURATION”﴿ that is set at the system‐wide level. This OCC record is very broad; it has fields for both dose and rate, but neither are required. It’s meant to apply to only ERX records that haven’t been configured for use.

What does all this mean? When configuring a medication, always attach an OCC!

Currently your trn3## silver sulfadiazine ERX record has no OCC record attached, so the system-level OCC is in use. Compare the order composer and the RX NONFORMULARY CONFIGURATION OCC record:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637956540801703635.png&ver=1660093280177)

You want your trn3## silver sulfadiazine to have Route and Frequency, but not Dose and Rate. The Route should be required. The RX BULK PRODUCTS DOSE NOT REQUIRED record can do this. Review the desired order composer, and the correct OCC record.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638029108567302881.png&ver=1667350056730)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|OCC records can and should be used for multiple ERXs that should have the same display items, summary items, and required items. In the Foundation System, there are about 50 OCC records that meet the needs for most medications. In training, we’ll focus on which OCC to use for different types of medications.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|An OCC attached to an ERX record will override the system-level OCC, but how? For Display Items and Summary Items, if any values are included in the more specific OCC they are the only values that will be applied. Display Items and Summary Items don't "combine" values from different OCCs. <br><br>For Item Control, each item is separate. If the Discrete Dose is included in the more specific OCC, it will override Discrete Dose from the system-level OCC. But if Route is not included, then the system-level value for Route will apply.|

To attach an OCC record to an ERX record:

1. Navigate to the Order Composer Configuration screen.
2. Enter a **Context** on the left.

- When configuring medications for hospital use, add the Inpatient context.

1. Enter the correct OCC record in the **Configuration** field on the right. 

Attach the RX BULK PRODUCTS DOSE NOT REQUIRED [4080200003] to your trn3## silver sulfadiazine record for Inpatient use.

- To use _Screen Fast Forward_, and jump to a specific screen, follow these steps:  
    Press **Home,** press **F9,** type "**t"** (to do a search by text), and type **"Order Composer Config"**. Finally press **Enter.**
- Alternatively, page down 36 times.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637921903835713318.png&ver=1656629583567)

Close your record in Text, and return to Hyperspace.

Order your trn3## silver sulfadiazine for Kristi.

- Yes! The Order Name looks great, and the Dose and Rate field are gone!

#### Configuring Other Order Composer Details

Compare your order composer to the desired order composer pictured. What still needs to be configured?

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638029108567302881.png&ver=1667350056730)

Correct defaults, dose buttons, and allowed routes.

Click the magnifying glass in the Route field. Should all of these routes be allowed for a cream? No

To make ordering as simple and safe as possible, always configure the following in any ERX record:

- **Default values:** Use the most common route or frequency as the default; the default appears in the field when the order composer opens
- **Allowed values:** Limit users to only appropriate routes or frequencies; allowed values appear when a user click the magnifying glass in these fields
- **Buttons:** Configure buttons for common options; the default value does NOT automatically become a button
- **PRN Reasons** (if PRN frequencies are used for the medication): Display appropriate reasons and select the most common reason﴾s﴿ by default

Administration Instructions

Certain medications should include administration instructions.

When adding administration instructions or product administration instructions to an ERX record, there are two options: 

- SmartText: To use this field, create a SmartText record in Classic, which can be attached to the ERX record.
    - This is a good option if the instructions are long, need to be formatted, very commonly used, or incorporate SmartLists or SmartLinks.
- Short text: To use this field, type the desired text. A wild card can be included in this field.

Review the administration instructions in your trn3## silver sulfadiazine. 

- There are no Admin or Product Admin Instructions; the Product Admin Instructions field is hidden. 
- What could we add to the ERX record to force the provider to enter details on where the nurse should apply the medication? An Admin Instruction with a wild card, like "Apply to ***".

### Configuring a Dosed Bulk Product

Dosed bulk products include inhalers, eye droppers, nasal sprays, and similar medications. The defining factors are:

- They have a discrete dose: a specific number of puffs, sprays, drops, etc.
- The available packages all include more than one use

|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|Gentamicin (Garamycin) 0.3% ophthalmic solution is a dosed bulk product. It’s an eye drop used to treat infections, dosed as either 1 drop or 2 drops. The smallest package distributed in the U.S. is a 5 mL bottle, which contains enough solution for a large number of doses.|

Open your Kristi patient’s chart. Place an order for gentamicin sulfate 0.3% ophthalmic solution [3428].

Configuring a dosed bulk product is similar to configuring a non-dosed bulk product. You still need to do the following:

1. Configure the Order Name, synonyms, and Order Display Name.

- The calculated dose is automatically included in the Order Name.

1. Configure the Display Items and Summary Items.

- You’ll use an OCC that includes the **Dose** field.

1. Configure defaults, buttons, and allowed options.

- You’ll set the default dose, dose buttons, and allowed order units.
- You will use the _Inpatient Order Composer Button Selections_ screen, to make the buttons appear in the order you want, and ensure that not all allowed routes become buttons.

1. Configure the default administration instructions (if any).
2. Configure the available and default PRN reasons (if any).

Because dosed bulk products have a discrete dose, you’ll also need to configure:

|   |
|---|
||

1. Dosing units and rounding factor(s)
2. Amount of drug contained within a dosing unit (sometimes)

Remove this order. You will be configuring your own trn3## copy of this medication.

#### In-Class Exercise: Configuring a Dosed Bulk Product

The gentamicin eye drop record is configured in the Foundation System, but your training copy appears as it would if it were a new, non-configured ERX record from your third-party vendor.

##### Exercise 2: Configure Your Gentamicin Eye Drops

Part 1: Configure Naming

1. If you aren’t already, log into Clinical Administration (Text).
2. From the main Clinical Administration menu, go to **Meds, Allergens, Imm, etc.** Then choose **Medications (ERX)**.
3. Enter “TRN3## GENT” _(replacing ## with your assigned number)_ and press **ENTER**. When asked, enter contact “1” and press **ENTER**.

- You are configuring a copy of a record created for you for this class, you are NOT creating a new record.

1. On the first screen, enter the following synonyms:

- Garamycin
- Genoptic
- GENT.3

1. Page down 21 times to the **Inpatient Order Defaults** screen.
2. In the **Order Display Name** field, enter:

“trn3## gentamicin (Garamycin) ophthalmic solution 0.3%” _(replacing ## with your assigned number)._

1. Page down 2 times to the **Medication Order Name Text** screen. Configure these fields as shown:

- **Medication Short Name:** trn3## gentamicin  
    _(replacing ## with your assigned number)_
- **Medication Brand Name:** Garamycin
- **Inpatient Order Name Suffix:** ophthalmic solution

1. Page down 1 time to the **Medication Order Name Options** screen. Configure these fields as shown:

- **Include Strength in Order Name?** Yes
- **Include Form in Order Name?** No

1. Press **SHIFT+F7** to close your record.

**Part 2: Test Your Names**

1. Log into Hyperspace as your pharmacist and open Kristi’s chart.
2. Click **+ New**. Search for “TRN3## Garamycin” _(replacing ## with your assigned number)_.

- Which field(s) did the system match on when you searched for “TRN3## Garamycin”?

Both the record name (which includes "TRN3##") and synonyms (which includes "Garamycin"); please note that while the Order Display Name does appear on the Database tab, the Database tab does not search via that name. Only the Preference List and Facility List tabs search via the Order Display Name.

- Confirm that the name you see on the Database tab looks like this. Which field caused the name to appear like this? ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637838009141018099.png&ver=1648240114010)

Order Display Name, plus the Synonym appearing in the "(aka Garamycin)" part. 

1. Accept the order.

- The Order Name should now look like this. Which fields did you configure to make it look like this?  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637255768271580627.png&ver=1590016027263)

Medication short name ("trn3## gentamicin"), Medication brand name ("Garamcyin"), Inpatient order name suffix ("ophthalmic solution"), Include strength in order name? ("Yes"), Include form in order name? ("No"). 

1. Click **Cancel** to close the Order Composer.

Part 3: Configure the Order Composer

1. Return to Text and open your TRN3## GENTAMICIN record. (Hint: =)
2. Page down 21 times to the **Inpatient Order Defaults** screen. Set the **Default Frequency** to Every 4 hours scheduled [200059].
3. At the bottom of the screen, under the **Suggested Doses for Order Entry**, enter the following:

|Dose|Units|Default?|
|---|---|---|
|1|drop|yes|
|2|drop||

- Each of these will appear as a button, with “1 drop” selected by default.

1. Page down 11 times to the **Rx Order Setup** screen.
2. Under **Allowed Order Units** field, enter “drop”.

- Controls which units you can select when entering a dose
- If left blank, you can select _any_ unit (even ones that don’t make sense).

1. On the same screen, enter the following allowed routes. You want to force the ordering user to specify which eye(s), so under the **Default?** column, enter “No” in each line:

- Both Eyes
- Left Eye
- Right Eye
- Ophthalmic

- If the **Default?** column is blank, the first allowed route is set as the default.

1. Page down 28 times to the **Inpatient Order Composer Button Selections** screen. Make the following frequencies buttons:

- 3 times daily [200045]
- 4 times daily [200042]
- Every 4 hours scheduled [200059]

1. On the same screen, designate the following three route buttons:

- Both Eyes
- Left Eye
- Right Eye

1. Press **SHIFT+F7** to close your record.

Part 4: Test Your Order Composer

1. Return to Hyperspace and CLOSE your Kristi patient’s chart. Discard any unsaved changes if prompted. (This will ensure that you see all of the configuration you’ve done in Text.)
2. Open Kristi’s chart again (use the **Orders** button) and order your trn3## gentamicin.

- The Order Composer opens automatically. Why?

There is no default route and that is a required field.

- Do you see the dose buttons and default dose you configured? Yes/No

You should. If you don't, close the chart and reorder.

- Are you able to change the dose unit? Why or why not?

No; because "drop" is the only allowed unit.

1. Clear the **Dose** button, so that no dose is selected, and press **Tab**.

- Are you _required_ to have a dose on this order? _Should_ a dose be required?

No (it's a yield sign). Yes, a dose should be required.

- There’s also a **Rate** field, which is not appropriate. What should you do to remove the Rate field and make the Dose required?

Attach an appropriate Order Composer Configuration (OCC).

Part 5: Configure Your Display Items & Item Control

Every ERX record you configure should have an Order Composer Configuration (OCC) record attached to it. The exercise didn’t have you attach one yet. The current settings are from the system-default OCC, for non-configured meds. Let’s fix that.

1. Remove your trn3## gentamicin order.
2. Go back to Text and open your trn3## gentamicin record (Hint: =)
3. Page down 57 times to the **Order Composer Configuration** screen.
4. Configure the screen like so:

|Context|Configuration|
|---|---|
|Inpatient|TRN3## RX SIMPLE MED|

_(replacing ## with your assigned number)_

- The “RX SIMPLE MED” OCC is the most commonly used OCC in the Foundation System. It’s used for the majority of medications.

1. Let’s see what this OCC record looks like. Press the **UP ARROW** key once, so your cursor is on the same row as “Inpatient” and “TRN3## RX SIMPLE MED.” Then press **F8**.

- You just “jumped” into the OCC record. This is a copy of the standard “RX SIMPLE MED” record in the Foundation System.

1. Page down once to the Medication Items screen.

- Arrow down through the **Display Items** section. Is “Rate” listed?
- Look under **Item Control** and **Item Status**. Notice that “Discrete Dose” is listed as “Required.”
- **Frequency** and **Route** will always be required, because they are configured to be required in the system-default OCC.
- **PRN Reason** will only be required when a PRN Frequency is selected.
- Notice how the **Summary Items** section is blank. That section controls the Summary Sentence. Because it’s blank in this OCC, where will the system get the Summary Items for your order?

From the system-default OCC.

1. Press **PAGE DOWN** to leave the OCC, and return to your ERX record. Then press **SHIFT+F7** to close your record.
2. Return to Hyperspace.
3. Order your TRN3## gentamicin again. Check these things:

- The **Rate** field is gone.
- The **Dose** is required (Hint: clear the **Dose** button.)
- **Route** and **Frequency** are still required.
- If so, you’ve properly configured your medication. Almost…

1. In the **Dose** field, try manually entering a dose of “1.5 Drop”.

- Does the system let you enter that dose? _Should_ it?
- After this exercise, your instructor will show you how to prevent that from happening.

1. If you have time, continue to the next page.

##### If You Have Time: Configure Another Dosed Product

Apply what you’ve learned so far to configure your TRN3## FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE 50 MCG/ACT NA SUSP (with the 3## matching the TRN3## from your class info sheet) to look like the screenshot below by default:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637838021494964032.png&ver=1648241349417)

In addition to what you can see in the screenshot:

- Users should be able to search for this product using “FLONASE” or “FLUT50”.
- When it’s added to a preference list or appears on the Database tab, the default display name should be: “trn3## fluticasone (Flonase) nasal spray 50 mcg/spray” (replacing ## with the ## from your class info sheet).
- Any frequency should be allowed.
- The allowed routes should be “Each Nostril” and “Nasal.”
- “Spray” should be the only allowed dosing unit.

Be sure to test your work. Order your medication for your Kristi patient and compare it to the screenshot and bullet points above.

#### Configure Dosing Units

Dosing units are the different ways you measure a medication when dosing it, administering it, or dispensing it. Epic converts between these units, and applies appropriate rounding.

If you don’t do this step, your users will be able to accidentally order doses like “1.5 puffs” or “0.2 drops.”

Place an order for your trn3## gentamicin with a dose of 1.5 drops and a route of both eyes.

- Does the system stop you from placing this order? Is that administrable?

##### Configuring the Medication and Administration Units

Configure dosing units for a medication on the **Rx Unit Equivalence** screen.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637262547327057533.png&ver=1590693932800)

To configure this screen for a dosed bulk product:

1. In both the **Medication Unit** and **Administration Unit** fields, enter the unit in which this med is dosed.
2. In the **Administration Rnd Factor** field, enter “1” to prevent users from entering a fractional dose.

You don’t need to configure the **Dispense Unit** or **Rnd Factor** for most bulk products, because you’ll almost always dispense the entire package (and there might be different sizes of packages). You’ll learn how to configure that in the chapter on Managing Medication Lists.

Configure your TRN3## GENTAMICIN record as described above. (Hint: page down 28 times or use a _Screen Fast Forward search_)

In Hyperspace, switch your dose to “1 drop” and then back to “1.5 drop”. What happens?

##### Configuring Equivalences for Units

Some bulk products have dosing warnings. If that’s the case, you need to indicate how much drug is actually contained in each unit of administration.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|Fluticasone (Flonase) nasal spray is a dosed bulk product used to treat nasal inflammation. It’s dosed in “Sprays.” The third-party data vendor’s dose guidelines limit adult patients to 400 mcg/day. For dose warnings to work, you must note that each “spray” contains 50 mcg of fluticasone.|

  
To configure the equivalence between units, use the **Rx Qty** and **Unit** table. Enter a line for the medication/administration unit, and a second line to indicate how many mg/mcg/etc. there are in each unit.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637262548031908914.png&ver=1590694003270)

The Short Text will be ignored.|

#### Dispensing and Administration

The following fields are on the **Rx Unit Equivalence** screen.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Medication Unit|The unit that the medication is typically _ordered_ in.|
|Administration Unit|The unit that the medication is typically _administered_ in.|
|Administration Rnd Factor|The smallest amount that the product can be given in.<br><br>For example, an Admin Rnd Factor of 0.5 for a tablet means it can be split in half. The tablet cannot be quartered.|
|Rnd Method|When rounding a dose (based on the Rnd Factor), whether it will always round up, always round down, or round to the nearest multiple of the rounding factor.|

### Key Takeaways

Summary of the fields to configure for non-dosed and dosed bulk products:

- Order Name
    - **Medication Short Name:** _<generic name>_
    - **Medication Brand Name:** _<Brand Name>_
    - **Inpatient Order Name Suffix:** _<form>_
    - **Include Strength in Order Name?**

Include when it is a percentage-based strength with two active ingredients or single ingredient available in multiple strengths

- **Include Form in Order Name?** No

- Order Display Name
    - _<generic name> (<Brand Name>) <form> <strength if appropriate>_
- Synonyms
- Default Frequency
- Allowed & Default Route
- Allowed Frequencies (typically not configured)
- Route Buttons & Frequency Buttons
- PRN Reasons (if appropriate)
- Default Administration Instructions (if appropriate)
- Order Composer Configuration
    - Non-dosed: RX BULK PRODUCTS DOSE NOT REQUIRED
    - Dosed: RX SIMPLE MED

#### Fields Specific to Dosed Bulk Products

- Suggested Doses for Order Entry
- Default Dose
- Allowed Order Units
- Medication Unit & Administration Unit
    - Typically these two units are the same for bulk products
- Administration Round Factor
    - Set to 1 to round to the nearest whole number.
- Equiv Qty & Unit table
    - One line for the administration/medication unit
    - One line for the amount of mg/mcg/etc. in each unit

#### Order Composer Configuration

The Order Composer Configuration (OCC) controls:

- Display items (fields in the Order Composer)
- Required vs. recommended display items
- Summary sentence (in the Orders sidebar)

There are over two dozen OCCs in Foundation System.

When there is no OCC attached to an ERX record, the system uses system default OCC defined in System Definitions (LSD 24300).

- RX NON FORMULARY CONFIGURATION in Foundation System.

The available OCCs should cover most ordering needs, but if needed, you can create custom OCCs.

**Path: Clinical Administration >> Meds, Allergens, Imm, etc. >> Order Composer Config (OCC)**

- Some display item listed in the OCC may not appear if they are not configured in the ERX record. Example: Ordering Instructions
- Required display items will appear in the Order Composer even if they are not listed as a Display Item. Example: PRN Reasons and Comments
    - PRN reasons and comments do not appear until a PRN frequency is specified.

### Importing Medications

Any time you're planning on modifying more than a handful of medication records at once, use an import spreadsheet. Using an import spreadsheet allows you to make the same change to many similar medication records without having to open each record in Clinical Administration. You might also use an import to do initial configuration of number of medications after a medication load, or to add information needed for new functionality.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|Use import specification ERX,1001-ERX All Items Import. Note that this import specification can't be used to modify all items in the ERX master file. It can, however, be used to modify all items relevant to inpatient medication build.|

### Reviewing the Chapter

Review Questions

An analyst has asked you to take a look at a simple ERX record he’s configured for albuterol inhalers. Albuterol inhalers are dosed, multi-use products used to treat wheezing and/or shortness of breath. The two most common brand names are “Proventil” and “Ventolin.”

You pull up the med in the Orders activity, and it looks like this:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638491180497758559.png&ver=1713557249777)

1. The analyst’s first question is “where is my dose field? Where are my dose buttons? I’m sure I set them up.” Which of these explains why the dose field and buttons aren’t appearing? Choose ONE answer only.
    1. He attached the wrong OCC to this ERX
    2. He configured the default dose, but not the dose buttons
    3. He didn’t actually configure the Suggested Doses for this ERX
    4. He didn’t attach an OCC to this ERX record
    5. He didn’t configure the Medication & Administration Units on the Rx Unit Equivalency screen

The answer is A. It appears that he attached the RX BULK PRODUCT DOSE NOT REQUIRED Order Composer Configuration.

Answers B and C aren’t right, because you can tell that he configured Suggested Doses for this ERX. A dose (“2 puff”) is visible in the Order Name and the Summary Sentence, and you can’t configure a default dose without configuring buttons. Even if he had NOT configured the Suggested Doses, the Dose field would still appear unless he had specifically attached an OCC that did NOT include Dose as a Display Item. That also explains why D is wrong: if he hadn’t attached an OCC at all, the system-wide OCC would apply (and that includes Dose).

E is wrong because the Medication and Administration Units don’t affect whether the dose appears. They only affect how the system calculates and rounds the order dose and the calculated dose.

1. Based on the screenshot above, what else did the analyst do wrong while configuring this ERX record? Choose ONE answer only.
    1. He didn’t configure a default dose
    2. He didn’t configure any allowed routes
    3. He didn’t configure any PRN reasons
    4. He didn’t configure the short name, brand name, or suffix

The correct answer is C: he didn’t configure allowed PRN reasons. That’s why there is just a PRN Comment field (and why it’s required).

Answer A is wrong because although we can't see the Dose field in the screenshot, the "2 puff" in the Order Name is indicative of a default dose. Without that setting, there would be nothing following "inhaler".

Answer B is wrong because "Inhalation" is the only possible option. If the analyst had not configured any allowed routes, there would be a magnifying glass field with multiple options available.

Answer D is wrong because the Order Name for this ERX appears correctly: <generic name> (<Brand Names>) <form> <dose>.

1. You fix the problems from questions 1 and 2, but when testing this out, you find that the system lets you enter a dose of “1.5678 puff.” Which of these steps would prevent users from ordering this ERX with partial puffs? Choose ONE only.
    1. Configure the Administration Rnd Factor to be “1”
        
    2. Configure the Allowed Order Units field to be “puff”
        
    3. Configure the Equiv Qty and Unit table to include “1 puff”
        
    4. Configure the Suggested Doses for Order Entry to only include “1 puff” and “2 puff”
        

The correct answer is A. The Administration Rnd Factor (on the Rx Unit Equivalency screen) is what prevents orders from being placed in impossible fractions of a unit.

B is wrong because the Allowed Order Units field simply prevents you from dosing the med in anything other than puffs; it doesn’t impact the number of puffs you can administer. C is wrong because the Equiv Qty and Unit table is only used to convert between units. And D is wrong because the suggested doses are just buttons: the user can still free-text a dose.

Study Checklist

## 2. Building Pharmacies

### Introduction

A “pharmacy” in Epic is a record in the PHR master file. Each of these records represents a specific place from which you can dispense medications. Your central pharmacy will be built as a pharmacy record in Epic, but so will your satellite pharmacies, unit floor stocks, ADS cabinets, and even robots or carousels.

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able to…

- Determine whether one dose or the par level will be dispensed for PRN orders
- Determine whether PRNs go on the carts from this pharmacy
- Select a default pharmacy for a hospital
- Learn the basics of creating a pharmacy record

To do build or use utilities, you'll log into the Classic client as an administrator. You'll then test your work in Hyperspace (on the Hyperdrive client) as a pharmacist or other user.<br><br>For more information, see [Hyperdrive and Classic Clients in Project Team Training](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=100178273&PrefDocID=152379).|

### Creating a Central Pharmacy

The central pharmacy (sometimes referred to as the main pharmacy) contains every medication your hospital can dispense and it’s the place from which other pharmacies get their inventory. It is also the “dispense location of last resort.” If the system cannot find a more appropriate dispense location for an order, it will dispense from the central pharmacy.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|You order gentamicin eye drops in your trn3## Hospital. Without any pharmacy configuration, you are able to sign the order but cannot verify it.|

In Kristi's chart, place an order for your trn3## gentamicin, then click **Sign & Verify**. Choose telephone with readback and select Kristi's primary provider.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637844226413160702.png&ver=1648861841260)

Currently, there is no main pharmacy attached to Kristi's hospital; the system can't find a default pharmacy. Without a pharmacy, the system doesn't know which packages are available for dispensing, so the Package and Dispense amount are also missing.

Pharmacy records are built in Classic: **Classic >>** **Rx Admin >> Pharmacy Admin**.

In Classic, create a trn3## Central Pharmacy (replacing 3## with your TRN3##).

#### Pharmacy Naming

The Pharmacy’s record name may contain extra information not important to nurses. Which field changes how the name appears on the MAR?

The Name to display on MAR/work request field

Your pharmacy should be called “Central Pharmacy” on the MAR.  
 

#### Basic Dispensing Setup

The following fields on the General form of the record identify this pharmacy as a standard inpatient pharmacy, and determine what is available to be dispensed:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Type|Determines whether this pharmacy is an ADS cabinet, a robot, or another type of pharmacy. For all inpatient pharmacies that are not ADS cabinets or Robots, the **Type** is Standard.|
|Supported dispense types|Determines whether this pharmacy will be considered for inpatient dispenses, prescriptions/outpatient medication orders using Willow Ambulatory, or home infusions. Your hospital’s central pharmacy will always have at least **Facility-Administered Medications** selected.|
|Parent hospital/clinic|For revenue tracking and reporting purposes this field indicates which hospital or clinic this pharmacy is considered a part of. Any dispense location (pharmacy) in a hospital will generally have the same **Parent Hospital/Clinic**.<br><br>Doesn’t affect how Epic picks a dispense location|
|Medication list|Defines which medications and packages are available to dispense from this pharmacy.|

Make it a Standard pharmacy.

Your pharmacy does not fill prescriptions.

Your pharmacy is a part of your trn3## Hospital for revenue tracking.

Make sure your pharmacy has the medications on “trn3## Central Pharmacy Med List” available for dispensing.  
 

#### How Will PRN Doses Be Dispensed?

The PRN Par Level is an estimate of how many doses of a PRN order are needed over 24 hours. Check the **Use PRN par level to calculate the number of doses to dispense** box on the Dispensing Information form of the record if you want the system to calculate a PRN par level.

The PRN par level is dispensed when first or cart doses are needed. If there is no PRN par level for an order, a single dose is dispensed when the order is verified.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|If you enable PRN Par level, an order with the frequency q6h PRN might have a PRN par level of 4. When the order is verified, you will get 4 first doses. On the next cart, if it goes on a cart, you’d get 4 cart doses.<br><br>If you don’t check the **Use PRN par level…** box in this example, the system would dispense just one first dose when the order is verified.<br><br>This setting also effects the dispense action that is generated by orders with a PRN frequency. When **Use PRN par level...** is checked, PRN orders generate PRN Par Dispense actions. When it is not checked, PRN orders will generate regular Dispense actions.|

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638470416304655518.png&ver=1711480830477)

Configure the system to estimate the number of doses needed over 24 hours for PRN orders.

- This setting is made on the **Dispensing Information** form

Close your Pharmacy record.

##### Beyond the Basics: Calculating the PRN Par Level

If you’ve enabled the PRN par level to be calculated, how does the system know the PRN par level? The par level can be set a few places. Here they are in the order the system searches:

1. ERX record: **Par Level Specific to this Medication by Frequency** field
2. ERX record: **PRN Par Level Specific to this Medication** field
3. Frequency record: **Medication PRN par level for dispensing** field

If all of the above fields are blank, the PRN par level is based on the number of doses that would be dispensed over 24 hours if the frequency was not PRN.

### Designating a Pharmacy as the Main Pharmacy

Once you have created your central pharmacy record, you need to link it to the Location record that represents your hospital. This setting establishes the Central Pharmacy as the default or “failsafe” pharmacy for this hospital. This is done in Classic, on the General form of the Hospital record.

**Path: Classic >> Rx Admin >> Hospital/Clinic Admin**

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638295104804218601.png&ver=1693949680403)

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637262595380053148.png&ver=1590698738080)

Set your central pharmacy as the main pharmacy in your TRN3## Hospital.

**Accept** your changes.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|If you don’t do the step above, the system will NOT recognize your pharmacy as the main (central) pharmacy for the hospital. Orders for patients admitted to that hospital might not have a dispense location or a package to dispense (which will prevent them from being verified).<br><br>Not having a Main pharmacy entered will also prevent Intelligent Medication Selection (IMS) from working (you’ll see why in RX405).|

### In-Class Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Testing Your Central Pharmacy

Check your build to make sure it works.

1. Close your pharmacy and hospital records if they are still open.
2. Back in Hyperspace, go to the Orders activity for your Kristi patient.

- Kristi is admitted to your trn3## Hospital, the one for which you just set up the central pharmacy.

1. Discontinue any active orders that Kristi has.
2. Search for and select (but do not sign) the following:

- Furosemide (Lasix) solution 10 mg/mL [3292]  
    _(0.5 mg/kg, Oral, Daily)_
- LORazepam (A) tablet [4572]  
    _(0.5 mg, Oral, q6h PRN)_
- your TRN3## GENTAMICIN SULFATE 0.3% OP SOLN  
    _(1 drop, Both Eyes, q4h SCH)_

1. Click **Sign & Verify**. Override any warnings you receive. Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider
2. Look at the furosemide order in the Verify Orders activity.

- Look at the **Dispense From** field. Where is this medication coming from?
- This medication will dispense from your trn3## Central Pharmacy because that’s the only pharmacy you’ve set up so far in your hospital.
- Look at the Products to Dispense section. The **Package** is a 4 mL cup. You will dispense the entire package. This NDC is the default set up on your medication list, as you’ll see in the next chapter.

1. Verify the furosemide.
2. Look at the lorazepam order.

- Check out the **PRN Par Level** field (on the right side). How many doses are being dispensed? What setting caused this to happen? 

4 doses. Selecting Use PRN Par Level to calculate the number of doses to dispense

1. Verify the lorazepam.
2. Go to the order for your trn3## gentamicin eye drops.

- Look at **Dispense From**. This medication will dispense from your trn3## Central Pharmacy because that’s the only pharmacy you’ve set up so far in your hospital.
- Look at the **Package** field. Is there a package? Yes / No
- Look at **Dispense** field. Should pharmacy dispense the whole package or just 1 drop?
- The whole package should be dispensed, but that’s not happening now. **Dispense** is blank, too. In the next lesson, you’ll learn how to configure these fields.

1. Reject the order for gentamicin. Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider. Close Kristi’s chart.

#### If You Have Time: Creating a Satellite Pharmacy

Use what you learned in this lesson to build a satellite pharmacy.

##### Part 1: Configure Standard Pharmacy Settings

This exercise is less guided. Complete the following tasks:

1. In Classic, create a pharmacy record (PHR record) called “trn3## 3 North Satellite Pharmacy” (replacing ## with your assigned number).
2. On the MAR, nurses should see the name “3-North Satellite”.
3. This pharmacy is a standard, staffed inpatient pharmacy. (Hint: Use the **Type** field.)
4. Allow Facility-Administered Medications, but not prescriptions from this pharmacy.
5. The **Parent Hospital** for this pharmacy is your trn3## Hospital.
6. This pharmacy dispenses all the meds on your trn3## 3 North Satellite Med List medication list

##### Part 2: Configure the Satellite Pharmacy’s Schedule

In a pharmacy record you are able to set open and closed hours, and the pharmacy that should cover while it’s closed.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|Your satellite pharmacy is only staffed from 0600 to 0900 on weekdays (unrealistic, but useful for testing this exercise!). When closed, medications should dispense from Central Pharmacy instead.|

1. In your trn3## 3 North Satellite Pharmacy, select the **Others** form.
2. Fill out the **Hours of Operation/Covering Pharmacies** according to the scenario above. It should look like this when you're finished:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638470432732454267.png&ver=1711482473250)

- Adding the Covering Pharmacy causes your central pharmacy to appear as the covering pharmacy by default when the satellite pharmacy closes (based on this schedule). 

1. Select the **General** form.
2. In the **Default covering pharmacy** field enter “trn3## Central Pharmacy”

- This causes your central pharmacy to appear as the covering pharmacy by default when a user manually closes this pharmacy.

1. The covering pharmacy feature only works for pharmacies that print labels. You’ll learn how to do that in an upcoming lesson, but for now, go to your satellite pharmacy’s Label Routing form and fill in these columns EXACTLY as seen here (be careful in the Action field!):

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637473501741086373.png&ver=1611796574110)

1. Close your pharmacy record.

##### Part 3: Test Your Satellite Pharmacy

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|On weekdays, you’ll have to wait until after 0900 to do the following steps.|

1. If you aren’t already, log into Hyperspace as your pharmacist. Go to the Orders activity for your Kristi patient.
2. Search for "101" (to select ACETAMINOPHEN 650 MG PO TABS).
3. Click **Sign.** Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider.
4. If you see any medication warnings, override them.
5. Go to the Medications activity. Select the acetaminophen you just ordered and click **Order Hx**.
6. Click **Dispense** to redispense this order.
7. Change the dispensing pharmacy to your trn3## 3 North Satellite Pharmacy. A message pops up indicating that the satellite pharmacy is closed. That is because it is after 0900!
8. Click **No** and then cancel your dispense.

### Key Takeaways: Configuring a Satellite Pharmacy

Satellite pharmacies are smaller pharmacies that are typically located near the specific units they serve. Unlike the central pharmacy, they are often only staffed during certain times of day. While they are closed, another pharmacy (usually the central pharmacy) “covers” for them and dispenses their doses.

You set up a satellite pharmacy almost exactly the same way as your central pharmacy but there are two additional settings:

1. The satellite pharmacy’s schedule and covering pharmacy.

- **Path: Pharmacy record >> Others** **form**
- The covering pharmacy will dispense doses when the satellite is _scheduled_ to be closed.

1. The covering pharmacy for _unplanned_ closings.

- **Path: Pharmacy record >> General form**
- Covers when pharmacy is manually closed (**Search >> Pharmacy Open/Close)**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|When a pharmacy is “closed,” the system will still potentially choose it as the dispense location for an order. But behind the scenes, the system will recognize that it is closed and reroute dispenses to the covering pharmacy.|

### Reviewing the Chapter

Review Questions

1. How do you define which medications can be dispensed from a pharmacy?

By plugging in a medication list record (an EFY record) in the Medication List field of the pharmacy record.

1. True or False: To allow orders within a hospital to dispense from the central pharmacy, you must link the hospital to the central pharmacy via the Parent hospital/clinic field.

False. While that field is important (it allows for proper revenue tracking), it does not affect dispensing. In the Hospital record in Classic, enter your central pharmacy record in the Main Pharmacy field.

1. How is creating a satellite pharmacy PHR different than creating a central pharmacy PHR?

They are very similar in their structure. However, if the satellite pharmacy is not open all day every day, you need to set the closed days and times on the Others form. There, you should also set a pharmacy to cover for the satellite pharmacy during planned closures. To set a covering pharmacy for unplanned closures, list a covering pharmacy on the General form too.

Study Checklist

Make sure you can define the following key terms:

Central Pharmacy

PRN par level

Satellite pharmacy

Covering pharmacy

Make sure you can perform the following tasks:

Create a PHR record for your main pharmacy

Configure the naming for your pharmacy record appropriately

Designate a PHR record as a hospital’s main pharmacy

Create a satellite pharmacy that has open and close times

Configure a default covering pharmacy for the Pharmacy Open/Close activity

Make sure you fully understand and can explain the following concepts:

Why a satellite pharmacy would need an open/close schedule

Why a satellite pharmacy might need to be opened/closed manually

## 3. Managing Medication Lists

### Introduction

One of the first tasks you perform when you begin installing Willow Inpatient is to create the _central pharmacy medication list_. This list:

- Includes all the medication _products_ and _packages_ that are generally available in your central pharmacy
- Is used to create other, smaller medication lists (such as your hospital’s formulary and the list of medications available in other dispense locations)
- Is used to create the Facility List that providers use when searching for orders
- Generally tells you which ERX records need to be configured for use

Your Epic representative will help you create this list when you begin your installation, but it is crucial that you understand what this list is, what it does, and how to update it.

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able to…

- Describe what a medication list _is_ and what it _does_
- Manually update the products and packages on a medication list
- Describe how your central pharmacy’s medication list is typically generated

### Adding to a Medication List

Each record in the _medication list_ master file contains a list of medication (ERX) records and package (NDC) records. Each medication list serves one of these purposes:

- It lists all of the medications and packages _available in a particular dispense location_ (majority of Medication List records) or…
- It lists all of the medications and packages that are considered _on formulary for your hospital_.

You can create and edit medication list (EFY) records in Classic: **Rx Admin >>** **Medication List Admin**.

In Classic, open your trn3## Central Pharmacy Med List.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|_What’s up with the Green Dots in “P” Column?_<br><br>It’s possible to populate a preference list (LPF) from a medication list. When you do, only the medications with a green dot in the “P” column are added to the preference list. You’ll learn more about this in a later chapter.|

#### What Medication (ERX) and Package (NDC) Records Are on a Medication List?

When you open a medication list (EFY) record, you see all of the medication (ERX) records on that list. Double-click a medication to see _every_ NDC associated with that ERX record. NDCs with a check mark in the M column are included on this list (that is to say, they are available in a particular dispense location).

Double-click LORAZEPAM 0.5 MG PO TABS [4572].

- How many NDC(s) are available to dispense? 1       
- Why is the available NDC crossed out? It has been discontinued by the manufacturer.
- Click **Close** to return to the list of ERXs.

#### What Do the Package (NDC) Records on a Medication List Do?

When a medication list (EFY) record is attached to a pharmacy (PHR) record, the system uses the medication list to determine what medications and packages are dispensed from that location.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637262606664035452.png&ver=1590699866480&ver=1590699866480)

An order for furosemide: The system uses details from the medication list attached to the dispense location

Double-click FUROSEMIDE 10 MG/ML PO SOLN [3292].

- How many NDC(s) are available to dispense? 2         
- Which NDC is dispensed by default? The 4 mL Cup 
- Why does the 4 mL cup have a yellow dot? It's a unit-dose package; you want to dispense the entire cup.

**TRAINER DEMO**: Your Trainer will place an order for furosemide [3292] and open the order composer.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=U:\Production\Online%20Publisher\Images\train_critical.png&ver=1590174660317)|**As a rule****:**<br><br>- Do NOT select the P column for pills, larger-volume bottles, or vials from which you draw up smaller doses of liquids.<br>- SELECT the P column for multi-dose packages, single-use syringes, vials, cups of liquid, bags of IV fluids, and premixed IV piggybacks.|

Click **Close** to return to the list of ERXs.

#### Adding Multi-Dose Packages to a Medication List

When a physician orders a multi-dose package, the entire package should be dispensed and not dispensed again until the nurse requests it. To make this happen, **Dispense package** and **Dispense only once** should be checked by default.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|When you order gentamicin eye drops, you see it is missing a default package. Also, **Dispense only once** is not checked.|

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637262610912454793.png&ver=1590700291320&ver=1590700291320)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|The **Contains multiple doses (single patient)** field can also be set in an individual NDC record. But for most multi-dose bulk medications, _every_ NDC includes multiple doses. So, it makes more sense to make that setting in the ERX record.|

Click **Edit** in the upper left corner of your trn3## Central Pharmacy Med List.

Click **Add** near the bottom right corner and search for your TRN3## GENTAMICIN SULFATE 0.3 % OP SOLN in the **Medication** field.

Indicate that you use NDC 17478-283-10 (the 5 mL bottle from AKORN and that you always dispense the entire bottle.

Indicate that all packages of the medication contain multiple doses for a single patient.

Click **Accept** and close the Medication List.

In Kristi’s chart back in Hyperspace, order your trn3## gentamicin eye drops with a route of Both Eyes. In the Order Composer, confirm that:

- The **Package** field shows “5 mL Bottle (17478-283-10)”
- The **Dispense package** and **Dispense once** check boxes are selected.

Remove the gentamicin order.

### Importing the Central Pharmacy List

When you begin installing Willow Inpatient, one of your first steps will be to create the medication list for your first hospital’s central pharmacy.

The list will represent every medication product (ERX) and package (NDC) that you stock, which could be 2,000-5,000 medications. Building the list by hand would take too long, so we import it. Below is an overview of the process.

#### Overview

At a high level, the process works like this:

1. Assemble NDCs

- Assemble a list of NDCs currently in use at your pharmacy in a special Excel spreadsheet that your Epic representative will supply.
- At the same time, your third-party data vendor will provide its list of NDCs, and that list will be loaded into your system.

1. Validate NDCs

- Run a macro in the Excel spreadsheet that compares your list of NDCs to the NDCs from your third-party vendor.
- Any NDCs that do not exist will be highlighted (because they are no longer active, not in the third-party data, or custom NDCs that you created in your prior system).

1. Fix “bad” NDCs and run the macro again.

- Repeat until all NDCs are clean.

1. Run another macro that turns your spreadsheet into a “flat file.”
2. Transfer the “Flat File” to Your Epic Server.
3. Scan and Import the “Flat File:”

- Scan file again for NDC errors, this time in Chronicles.
- Assuming there are none, you run the file through an _import specification_ that translates the file into a medication list (EFY) record.

For hands-on practice, check out the [Core Analyst Badge](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=3753799) on Galaxy.|

### Reviewing the Chapter

Review Questions

1. Name two purposes that the central pharmacy Med List (EFY) record serves.

The central pharmacy EFY record contains every medication that is dispensed in your hospital. This EFY record (like most EFY records) defines which NDCs are physically stocked and dispensed for each ERX record.

1. How should you dispense a multi-dose package differently from a single-dose package?

A multi-dose package should be dispensed only once automatically after it is ordered and verified. Any redispenses will be requested manually. A single-dose package should automatically dispense a new package for each dose due.

1. What must you do in Epic to force a package to dispense only once automatically?
    1. In the medication (ERX) record, enter “yes” in the Package contains multiple doses (single patient) field.
    2. Add a yellow dot in the P column on the medication list.
    3. Add a red dot in the D column on the medication list.
    4. Add a check mark in the M column on the medication list.

A. In the medication (ERX) record, enter “yes” in the Package contains multiple doses (single patient) field.

Study Checklist

Make sure you can define the following key terms:

Medication List (EFY) record

Central Pharmacy Med List

Make sure you can perform the following tasks:

Manually add a medication to an EFY record.

Indicate which packages (NDCs) are available for a medication (ERX) record.

Indicate which package (NDC) should be dispensed by default for a medication.

Indicate that an entire package should be dispensed.

Add a bulk multi-dose product to a medication list so that the system knows to only dispense it once when ordered

Make sure you fully understand and can explain the following concepts:

Why Medication List (EFY) records are important

What medications and NDCs should go on your central pharmacy’s medication list record

When you would configure a Medication List to dispense an entire package vs. part of a package

How your central pharmacy’s medication list is initially created

Why you might manually edit your central pharmacy’s medication list

## 4. Configuring Cart Fills

### Introduction

When dispensing medications from the main pharmacy, many hospitals choose to streamline the process by grouping similar medications that are due within the same period of time. In RX100, you saw that we can configure Epic to manage this process by using cart fill functionality.

Before configuring the system, you need to make a few decisions:

- Which pharmacy does the cart dispense from?
- Which units should the cart deliver to?
- Which medications should be included on the cart?
- When should the cart be prepared and delivered?
- Should a report print to indicate to pharmacy staff that medications should be added to the cart? If so, how often should it print? What type of report? Should a report display in Hyperspace?
- Should labels print to indicate that medications should be added to the cart? Should the labels print automatically or be held in the Dispense Queue?

In this chapter you’ll see how to configure a cart (CRT) record to align with these decisions.

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able to…

- Configure a cart (CRT) record to meet given specifications
- Describe how dispense codes are used to assign medications to a cart and how to indicate this in the system
- Accurately predict which doses will go on a cart and which will be first doses

### Generating Dispense Actions

When the system thinks that a medication should be dispensed, it creates an action in Order Hx. The list of possible actions is hard-coded in the system, based on buttons and screens in end-user workflows. You will not add to or remove from the list of actions.

#### Exercise 1: Exploring when Dispense Actions Occur

In this exercise, you’ll explore several actions that indicate that dispensing should happen.

##### Part 1: Does the System Think We Dispensed a Med?

1. From Hyperspace, in Kristi’s chart, discontinue any active orders. Select telephone with readback and select Kristi's attending provider.
2. Enter new orders for:

- Your TRN3## GENTAMICIN SULFATE 0.3 % OP SOLN (both eyes)
- FUROSEMIDE 10MG/ML PO SOLN [3292] (change the frequency to Q12H)

1. Click **Sign**. Override any warnings you see. Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider.
2. Go to the Medications activity. Select the active gentamicin order and click **Order Hx**.

- Note that there is only one “Dispense (First Dose)” action, because you configured this bulk product to dispense only once. That dispense action is appearing because you verified the order. That’s great!
- When the nurse runs out after several days, they will contact the pharmacy and ask them to dispense another. 

1. Click **Dispense** and then **Accept** to dispense another gentamicin.

- Now you see a “Redispense” action.
- That is what will happen when a nurse request more.

1. Close Order Hx.
2. Back in the Medications activity. Select the active furosemide order and click **Order Hx**.

- Note that there is only one “Dispense (First Dose)” action, but we need two doses per day since the frequency was Q12H.
- With the configuration that we’ve done up until this point, this is the only dispense action that will ever exist for furosemide unless we manually redispense it like we did for the gentamicin. That’s not good. We want the system to automatically dispense furosemide before it is needed so that a nurse doesn’t need to contact the pharmacy each time they need a dose. To do that, we must set up a cart.

1. Close **Order Hx**.

##### Part 2: Focus Questions

Use what you learned in the exercise to answer the following questions.

1. What did you do in the system to cause a Dispense (First Dose) action to occur?

Clicked Verify

1. Why is it NOT a problem that only one Dispense (First Dose) action occurred for the gentamicin?

This is a bulk medication. The nurse does not expect it to dispense again automatically. The nurse expects to call the pharmacy when they need more.

1. Why is it a problem that only one Dispense (First Dose) action occurred for the furosemide?

The nurse is going to need it again soon and be expecting the folks in the Central Pharmacy to dispense it.

Subsequent doses will only dispense if pharmacy staff manually redispense them. If your organization is “cartless,” you may rely more on ADS cabinets and floor stocks.|

### Setting up a Cart

Manage the first few decision points on the first screen of a cart (CRT) record.

**Path: Classic >> Rx Admin >> Cart Admin**

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638451622736399810.png&ver=1709608673660)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|You have one cart that runs from your trn3## Central Pharmacy and delivers unit dose medications. The cart runs daily, delivering doses due between 8:00 pm that day and 8:00 pm the next day. It serves your trn3## 3 North Unit.|

In Classic, create “trn3## Unit Dose Cart” (replacing ## with your assigned number).

#### Which Pharmacy Does the Cart Dispense From?

When you create a new Cart (CRT) record, enter the parent pharmacy in the **Manage cart dispenses from pharmacy** field. The parent pharmacy is where these medications are being gathered or prepared, and where they will be dispensed from.

Configure your cart record to dispense from your TRN3## Central Pharmacy.

#### Which Units Should the Cart Deliver To?

Indicate which units the cart delivers to in the **Units served by cart** field. A small hospital may configure one cart to deliver to every unit, while a larger hospital may have one cart per one or two units.

Configure your cart record to serve your TRN3## 3 North Unit.

#### Which Medications are Included on the Cart?

##### Assigning Type of Medications

Next, indicate which types of medications are included on this cart. Each order is assigned to a cart group, based on its dispense code. Cart groups are mapped to dispense codes in Pharmacy System Definitions.

**Path: Rx Admin >> Pharmacy System Definitions >> Dispense Codes & Cart Groups**

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637262645337872973.png&ver=1590703733870)

Any ERX record that does not have a dispense code will use the **Default dispense code**.

Any dispense code not listed in the table will use the **Default cart group**.

Cart groups are choices on a category list (CRT 300). The Foundation System includes just five cart groups: IV, Syringe, Oral Syringe, TPN, and Unit Dose. Before you create any carts at your organization, you must decide if you need any additional cart groups and what they will be called.

Configure your cart record to deliver medications assigned to the Unit Dose cart group.

##### Beyond the Basics: Assigning PRN Orders to a Cart

Epic supports dispensing orders with PRN frequencies on carts, but by default, PRN orders are NOT included. If you want a cart to include PRN orders, select the **Create dispenses for PRN orders** checkbox in the cart record.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638451610968714991.png&ver=1709607496873)

The **Create dispenses for PRN orders** check box only works if the cart’s parent pharmacy _also_ has the **Assign PRN orders to appropriate cart** AND the **Use PRN par level to calculate the number of doses to dispense** boxes checked. Both check boxes must be selected.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637262645780247645.png&ver=1590703778107)

As a result of checking these boxes, each time the cart runs it will include the PRN par level of all PRN orders that have been deemed appropriate to add to the cart.

#### When Should the Cart be Stocked and Delivered?

First, decide which style of schedule editing is appropriate for your cart.

- **Cart interval specified per day of the week:** Use this option if your cart schedule varies based on the day of the week or if your interval is not in a number of days (24 hours)
- **Cart interval specified per every X days:** You will only use this option if your cart runs every X number of days on the same schedule. 

**Path: Cart Record >> Cart Schedule form**

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638451611232314202.png&ver=1709607523223)

Configure your cart scheduling to deliver doses due between 2000 and up to 2000 the next day, each day of the week.

Carts are usually set to run automatically on a preset schedule with times for starting, updating, and finalizing. In the Cart Schedule, you enter the time (in minutes) the action should occur prior to the cart’s interval.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638451618914427195.png&ver=1709608291443)

Configure your cart to do the following:

- Group doses that are due between 2000 and 2000 every day
- Start at 4:00 pm each day
- Update at 6:00 pm and 6:30 pm each day
- Finalize at 7:00 pm each day

Assign the WILLOW INPATIENT, GENERIC user to run the cart, and click **Enable Automation**. 

- This is not a real person; the user record allows us to automate the cart.

When pharmacies use carts to dispense medications that are prepared in an IV Room such as IVs or syringes, they often choose to forego running updates. This is because there is more time involved in preparing these types of medications, which leaves no time to prepare additional orders or make modifications to orders that are already on the cart. Remove the **Start** and **Update** columns by going to the **Cart Schedule** form and checking **Do not allow cart updates**.

### Review of Scheduling

As you learned in RX100, for orders dispensing from Central Pharmacy the system first determines if the order belongs to a cart. If it does belong to a cart (the patient’s unit and type of medication matches), the system then considers:

- Which cart interval does the dose fall into?
- Was the order verified before the finalize time of that cart interval?

If the answer to the second question is yes, then the dose is a _cart dose_. If the answer is no, then the dose is a _first dose_.

### Configuring Cart Reports

#### Printing Reports for a Cart

If the pharmacy uses a paper report to list orders that belong on a cart, configure which reports should print and when on the “Reports to print for scheduled actions” table. Reports can print at start, update, or finalize times.

**Path: Cart Record >> Cart Schedule form**

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638451620454710808.png&ver=1709608445477)

Configure your cart to print Rx Cart Fill C **UPDATE** by Dept/Patient (RTAG) [49126] when it is started, updated, or finalized to the printer NULL DEVICE [100].

- In the real world, you will put the name of an actual printer, we are just using NULL DEVICE as a placeholder for training purposes.

Configure your cart to print Rx Cart Fill C **FULL** by Dept/Patient (RTAG) [49125] when it is finalized to the printer NULL DEVICE [100].

#### Displaying Reports in Hyperspace for a Cart

 If you would like your reports to be visible in Hyperspace, go to the **Reporting** form and specify how the fill report and update report will look.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Sort Patients by**|Patients can be sorted by name or walk order.|
|**Default Full Report**|Shows total contents of the cart fill, factoring in all the updates that have been run since the cart was started|
|**Default Update Report**|Shows meds that need to be added to or removed from the cart since the last update|
|**Additional Cart Reports**|Specify other available reports. Examples include an audit trail report showing the history of updates and actions by users during a cart fill, and a summary report of orders without patient-specific information.|

Configure the **Default FULL report** to be “Rx Cart Fill C FULL by Dept/Patient (RTAG)” [49125].

Configure the **Default UPDATE report** to be “Rx Cart Fill C UPDATE by Dept/Patient (RTAG)” [49126].

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|Be sure to put a FULL report in the **Default FULL Report** field, and an UPDATE report in the **Default UPDATE Report** field.<br><br>The system will let you put the wrong type of report in each field, so be careful!|

#### Printing Labels

You can configure patient labels to print that display the patient's name, room and bed, and other identifying information. These are attached to envelopes or drawers on the cart that contain doses for that patient.

Configure an RX LABEL PATIENT report to print to the TRN CENTRAL CART FILL printer for every patient with orders.

Medications labels can print instead of or in addition to patient labels and paper reports. However, this is not configured in the CRT record. Dose and production labels are configured on the pharmacy (PHR) record’s Label Routing table. You’ll learn more about that in the next lesson.

### In-Class Exercises

|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=U:\Production\Online%20Publisher\Images\train_critical.png&ver=1590174660317)|The following exercise assumes that you have done all the steps and In-Class Exercises from the previous lessons. If you have not, this exercise may not work as written.|

#### Exercise 2: Testing Your New Cart

Test your new cart to see how users run cart fills in Hyperspace.

1. Click **Accept** to save your changes and close your cart record.
2. Back in Hyperspace, discontinue any existing orders for your Kristi patient.
3. Enter an order for FUROSEMIDE 10MG/ML PO SOLN [3292]

- Dose: 40 mg
- Frequency: BID
- First Dose: **Include Now**

1. Click **Sign & Verify**. If you get any alerts, override them. Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider.

- Look at the dispense code for the furosemide. Should this medication be included on the cart you just configured? Yes

1. Click **Verify**.

- Don't forget this step! It will impact your testing later on!

1. Back in Classic, open the Cart Fill activity by going to the main toolbar >> **Pharmacy >> Cart Fill**. 

1. Enter your trn3## Central Pharmacy in the "Pharmacy" search field and select your TRN3## Unit Dose Cart. 
2. At the bottom of the activity, click **Start**. If the Start button is grayed out, click **Update**. Your patient should now appear with an order for furosemide on the cart (_date and_ _number of doses may vary_):

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638245840948611137.png&ver=1689023294863)

1. Close the Cart Fill activity.
2. Back in Hyperspace, open Order Hx for Kristi’s furosemide order. (Hint: Medications >> select the order >> **Order Hx**)
3. Is there a first dose being dispensed? There should be at least one, since there is a dose due now that needs to get to the nurse ASAP.

- The pending cart dispenses appear as “Dispense (Pending)” because the cart has not yet finalized.

1. Pretend that it is now 7:00 pm, the time at which your cart finalizes. Return to Classic and reopen the Cart Fill activity for your trn3## Unit Dose Cart

- Hint: **Pharmacy >> Cart Fill >> trn3## Central Pharmacy >> trn3## Unit Dose Cart**

1. At the bottom of the activity, click **Finalize**. Yes, you're sure.
2. Close the Cart Fill activity.
3. Back in Hyperspace, refresh Order Hx for Kristi's furosemide order.

- The "Dispense (Pending)" actions should now be "Dispense (Cart Fill)" actions.

1. Close Order Hx.

#### Exercise 3: Setting Up a Cart for IVs and Syringes

Now you’ll create a cart that dispenses IVs and syringes to your unit.

##### Part 1: Create a Cart Record

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|Your hospital needs another cart to account for IVs and syringes! The cart should run from your trn3## Central Pharmacy, serve your trn3## 3 North Unit, and be automated. The cart should group doses due from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm and 8:00 pm to 8:00 am each day, and it should finalize two hours before the first potential due time. There should be no start or update times.|

1. In Classic, create “trn3## IV Batch”. _(Replacing ## with your assigned number)._

- Hint: **Classic** >> **Rx Admin** >> **Cart Admin** >> **Create** tab
- Carts that contain medications prepared in the IV room are sometimes referred to as “batches” because the same medications are often prepared at once in a batch.

1. Indicate that your cart is prepared and filled in your trn3## Central Pharmacy.

- Hint: Use **Manage Cart Dispenses from Pharmacy**

1. Set the cart to deliver to your trn3## 3 North Unit

- Hint: Use **Units served by cart**

1. Configure your cart to deliver medications assigned to the IV and Syringe cart groups.

- Hint: Use the **Cart Group** column. 

1. Go to the Cart Schedule form.
2. Ensure that **Cart interval specified per day of week** is selected.

- This will allow you to define two or more intervals on each day.

1. When the cart finalizes automatically, it should appear that "WILLOW INPATIENT, GENERIC USER” [RXGENERIC] finalized the cart.

- Hint: Use **Cart fill user**

1. Do NOT allow updates. Once the cart runs, it’s done.

- Hint: Select **Do not allow cart updates**

1. Configure the **Cart Day** and **Cart Time** columns to define two intervals for each day, one starting at 8:00 am another starting at 8:00 pm.

- Hint: You'll need to list each day of the week twice, for 14 rows total!
- Hint: In the Cart Time column, you can enter 24-hour time ("0800" and "2000") and the system will accept the values. 
- Note: You're defining the START of each interval. The system automatically ends one interval when the next interval begins.  
- When you're done, the table should look like this

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638451664846361187.png&ver=1709612884637)

1. After you have defined all your cart intervals, set each interval to finalize 2 hours (120 minutes) prior to each interval.

- Hint: Use the **Finalize** column, but only AFTER you have defined all your intervals. 
- Hint: enter "120" in the first row, then copy (CTRL + C), DOWN ARROW, and paste (CTRL+V).  
- CHECK: Do you see columns for **Start** and **Update**? If yes, then you forgot to select **Do not allow cart updates** on the General Info form. Fix that now! 

1. Automate the cart.
    - Hint: Click **Enable Automation**
2. You don't want anything to print, but when you manually run the cart in Classic or Hyperspace, the Total Fill button should appear, and display report 49125.

- Hint: On the **Reporting form**, enter "49125" in the **Default full report** field.
- You don't need to add anything in the **Default update report** field because this cart will not update.

1. Do NOT print any patient labels.

- Later in class, you'll configure medication labels to print instead that display this information for each IV dose.

1. Click **Accept** to save your changes and close your cart record.

##### Part 2: Test Your Cart

1. In Hyperspace, place the following order for your Kristi patient: ampicillin IV/IM [420002] (2 g, Intravenous, q4h)
2. Click **Sign & Verify**. Select telephone with readback and select Kristi's attending provider.
3. Notice the order's dispense code. The IVPB Mixture dispense code is mapped to the IV cart group, so this order is one that should be dispensed via your new cart.
4. **Verify** the order. Override any warnings.
5. Open Order Hx for your ampicillin order (Hint: **Medications** >> select the order >> **Order Hx**).

- Notice at least one Dispense (First Dose) action for the doses that are needed before the interval for the next cart.

1. Now let’s run your cart. In Classic, go to the Cart Fill activity and open your cart.

- Hint: on the main toolbar, go to **Pharmacy >> Cart Fill**, enter your TRN3## CENTRAL PHARMACY, and select your TRN3## IV BATCH.  

1. Click **Finalize** at the bottom of the screen. Yes, you’re sure. 

- If the Finalize button is grayed out, your cart may have automatically finalized. This happens when you create and automate your cart right after the finalize time, which is 5:00 am or 5:00 pm. If you think that is the case, move on to the next step!

1. Click **Total Fill List** to see the dispenses generated by this cart. 

- The ampicillin order should appear, dispensing 3 doses.  

1. Return to Hyperspace and refresh the Order Hx for your Kristi patient's ampicillin.

- You should now see 3 x Dispense (Cart Fill) actions, in addition to Dispense (First Dose) actions you saw earlier. 

##### If You Have Time: Focus Questions

1. Based on how you configured your unit dose cart, what notification will pharmacy staff receive letting them know they need to start preparing orders?

Reports will print.

1. Based on how you configured your cart for IVs and syringes, will pharmacy staff receive that same notification for doses on this cart?

No, we did not configure any reports to print for this CRT.

1. In addition to your answers above, how _else_ might you want pharmacy staff to be notified? (If you aren't sure, look at the title of the next lesson for a hint!)

Printed labels would sure be nice!

### Reviewing the Chapter

Review Questions

1. Match the decision point to the corresponding field in the cart (CRT) record. (There may be more than one answer for some of the questions.)  
    ____ Which pharmacy does the cart dispense from?  
    ____ Which units should the cart deliver to?  
    ____ Which medications are included on the cart?  
    ____ When should the cart be stocked and delivered to a unit?  
    ____ Should a report print?  
    ____ Should labels print?  
    ____ Should labels be held in the Dispense Queue?
    1. **Queue dispenses** checkbox
    2. **Manage cart dispenses from pharmacy:**
    3. **Reports to print for scheduled actions:**
    4. **Cart Group** column of the **Medications to include on cart:** table
    5. **Cart Schedule:**
    6. **Units served by cart:**
    7. Label Routing table in the PHR record
    8. **Finalize** column of the **Cart action schedule:** table

B     Which pharmacy does the cart dispense from?  
F     Which units should the cart deliver to?  
D    Which medications are included on the cart?  
E,H  When should the cart be stocked and delivered to a unit?  
C     Should a report print?  
G    Should labels print?  
A    Should labels be held in the Dispense Queue?

1. Where do you generally set the Cart Group for a given dispense code?

The Cart Groups are paired with dispense codes in System Definitions on the Dispense Codes and Carts Groups form.

1. Explain the Time field in the Cart schedule section of a cart record. What does it represent?

In the **Time** field you enter in the time of day when doses from the cart are first due to be administered to the patient. This represents the interval of doses due for the cart.

1. Labor Day is coming up. You need to temporarily change your cart’s schedule. True or False: You can change the cart’s schedule any time before Labor Day to make this adjustment.

False. If you change the cart’s schedule at the wrong time, you will lose doses from the cart. Always ask your Technical Services representative before making changes to carts in a live production system.

1. Using the screenshots, answer the following question. A pharmacist sees this in Verify Orders:  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637650602895108224.png&ver=1629499489520)  
      
    A cart is configured like this:  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638452264672137124.png&ver=1709672867220)  
      
    It’s 1700 right now. What happens in Order Hx when the pharmacist clicks Verify? (Choose ONE only.)
    1. One “Dispense (First Dose)” action appears
    2. Two “Dispense (First Dose)” actions appear
    3. Three “Dispense (First Dose)” actions appear
    4. Five “Dispense (First Dose)” actions appear

A. One “Dispense (First Dose)” action appears

The initial dose (at 1700) falls in today’s 1000 – 2200 cart interval, which finalized this morning at 0700. Because the order hadn’t been verified before 0700, any doses falling in that 1000 – 2200 interval are first doses.

The 2300 and 0500 doses fall in the 2200 – 1000 cart interval, which doesn’t finalize until 1900 (180 minutes prior to 2200). The order is verified at 1700, which is before that interval finalizes. Those two doses will be cart doses, not first doses. 

So, there will be one first dose.  

1. Refer to the screenshots in question 5. You verified the order at 1700. Assuming the order doesn’t change, which of the following are statements are true? (Choose ALL that apply.)
    1. At 1900, two “Dispense (Cart Fill)” actions will appear in Order Hx
    2. At 1900, three “Dispense (Cart Fill)” actions will appear in Order Hx
    3. At 2200, two “Dispense (Cart Fill)” actions will appear in Order Hx
    4. At 2200, three “Dispense (Cart Fill)” actions will appear in Order Hx

A is correct.

At 1900, the 2200 – 1000 interval will finalize (including the 2300 and 0500 doses of this order).

## 5. Setting up Label Printing

### Introduction

Label printing is crucial to dispensing medications correctly. Labels provide information about the medication in a particular package. Labels help the nursing staff administer medications correctly. Labels printed in the pharmacy notify the staff of a task.

This lesson focuses on how to set up Willow to print labels for bulk multi-dose products and for the IV and syringe cart you configured in the last lesson.

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able to…

- Configure dispense codes for medications
- Configure a pharmacy to print the correct types of labels at the right time
- Configure labels to print for a cart fill
- Send labels to the Dispense Queue

### What Kind of Label Prints?

In RX100, you learned that the dispense code determines which type of label prints to which printer. As you saw in the last chapter, it also determines which cart delivers the order.

If you assign medications the correct default dispense codes, pharmacists will save time because they aren’t correcting orders and the right labels will print at the right printers.

In Hyperspace, discontinue any active orders for Kristi and place a new order for trn3## gentamicin (both eyes).

Click **Sign & Verify**. Select telephone with readback and select Kristi's attending provider.

In Verify Orders, review your gentamicin order for Kristi.

- What is the Dispense Code? Does this make sense?

"Unit Dose".  Not really... it's a bulk product.

To configure medications with the correct dispense code:

1. Validate the list of dispense codes
2. Check the system default dispense code
3. Assign medication-specific dispense codes

#### Step 1: Validate the List of Dispense Codes

There is a list of dispense codes in the Foundation System. Make sure the list of dispense codes works for you. Add dispense codes when you need different labels for medications that are in the same group. Remove dispense codes when you print labels the same way for two different dispense codes.

Click the pencil icon next to Dispense Details and go to the Dispense Code field for Kristi’s gentamicin.

- Review the (many) dispense codes available. 
- Which one would you use for this type of order? Bulk

**Don't** change the dispense code for this order; click the arrow icon next to Dispense Details.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|You can edit the list of dispense codes in the **Category List Maintenance** activity (Classic >> search >> "Category List Maintenance"). Dispense codes are stored in ECT 9060.|

Be aware that the more you add to the list of dispense codes, the more work you will have in assigning those dispense codes to ERX records.

#### Step 2: Check the System Default Dispense Code

The most common dispense code is set as the default in System Definitions. This is set as Unit Dose in the Foundation System. If you change the system default, you will have to reevaluate the dispense code of every ERX record.

**Path: Rx Admin >> Pharmacy System Definitions >> Dispense Codes & Cart Groups form**  
![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637262665310733448.png&ver=1590705731153)

#### Step 3: Assign Medication-Specific Dispense Codes

For any medication that should have a dispense code different than the system default, assign the dispense code in that Medication (ERX) record:

1. **Path: Clinical Administration >> Meds, Allergens, Imm, etc. >> Medications (ERX)** >> select the medication record **>> Dispense Code Configuration** screen

- Use screen fast forward (**Home + F9**) or page down 38 times.

1. In the **Default dispense code** field, enter the dispense code.

Medications configured in the Foundation System with a dispense code must be validated. You will also add dispense codes for medications not configured in the Foundation System.

Assign your trn3## gentamicin eye drops a **Default dispense code** of “Bulk.”

Go back to Verify Orders for Kristi in Hyperspace. In your trn3## gentamicin eye drops, click the refresh button at the top right of the Dispense Information section. Confirm that your dispense code is now appropriate.

Click **Label Preview** for this order. Will a label print for this order?  No (first dose labels have not been configured.)

#### Confirm Whether a Label Has Printed

In many cases, labels should print to inform pharmacy staff that a medication order needs to be dispensed.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|A label should print every time there is a Dispense (First Dose) action for bulk medications such as gentamicin. A label should also print each time there is a Redispense action for bulk meds.|

To determine whether or not a label has printed, check Label Hx.

**Path in the patient’s chart: Medications >> choose medication order >> Label Hx**

**TRAINER DEMO**: Watch as your instructor verifies Kristi's gentamicin order, and confirms that no label printed. They'll then redispense the gentamicin, and demonstrate that not label printed for that action, either.

### Setting up Label Routing

You must configure label printing separately for each pharmacy. Every pharmacy has a unique set of printers, so the specific labels and destinations need to be different.

**Path: Rx Admin >> Pharmacy Admin >> Label Routing**  
![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637474239259074470.png&ver=1611870325927)

The following section describes these columns of the Label Routing table in more detail.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|_Other Columns in Label Routing_<br><br>There are additional columns on the Label Routing table that allow for other label needs. To learn more, refer to the [Configure Label Routing for Hospital Pharmacies](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=1608472&PrefDocID=98979) topic of the _Medication Labels Setup and Support Guide_.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Actions<br><br>“When this happens…”|In the first column, you’ll set up the action to trigger labels to print. Common actions include:<br><br>- **Dispense (First Dose)**. Occurs when doses are dispensed immediately upon verification. When a pharmacy is using the PRN par level to calculate the number of doses to dispense, it does NOT include PRN medications.<br>- **Dispense (1st First Dose)**. Occurs when the VERY FIRST of the first doses of a medication is dispensed. It does NOT include PRN medications.  <br>    OPTIONAL: only include this action in your Label Routing table if the very first dose should print differently than the other first doses.<br>- **Dispense (Cart Fill)**. Occurs when a medication is dispensed as part of a cart fill (or a batch). It does NOT include PRN medications.<br>- **1st Dispense Check.** Occurs when the first dose of a medication is checked in the Dispense Check activity.<br>- **PRN Par Dispense (First Dose)**. Similar to Dispense (First Dose), for PRN orders. These actions will only occur if you have enabled the "Use PRN par level..." setting in the Pharmacy (PHR) record.<br>- **PRN Par Dispense (Cart Fill)**. Similar to Dispense (Cart Fill), for PRN orders. These actions will only occur if you have configured PRN orders to be included on carts.<br>- **Redispense**. Occurs when a dose is manually dispensed.<br>- **Discontinue**. Occurs when an order is discontinued.<br><br>You can list a given action more than once, which lets you print multiple labels at the same time. Or you can leave out a particular action.<br><br>If you don’t include a line here for a particular action, then nothing will happen when that action occurs.<br><br>If you leave this field blank in an otherwise configured row, then a label will print for every action.|
|Dispense Codes<br><br>“…to this type of med…”|For each action, indicate which type of medication you want to address.<br><br>If you leave this field blank in an otherwise configured row, then the action will trigger with every med, regardless of dispense code.|
|Order SmartText<br><br>“…print this label…”|Labels are SmartText records. Since SmartTexts are highly configurable, you can set up your labels to include almost any information about a given med or information found in the patient’s record.|
|Destination<br><br>“…at this printer.”|Where the label prints, regardless of the patient location. Each printer is set up as a record in the workstation (LWS) master file.|
|Group?|You can set whether or not multiple doses for the same order should be grouped on a single label.<br><br>- Yes: Willow will print only one label for the order, regardless of how many doses are being dispensed with this action. This is a good choice for unit dose medications—you don’t want a separate label for each of four pills!<br>- No: Willow will print a separate label for each dose dispensed.<br><br>The default for this field is “No.” Note that this field has no impact on “order-level” actions such as Verify or Discontinue.|
|Copies|The number of copies of the label that should print. By default, a single label prints for the medication.|

#### Exercise 1: Configure Label Printing

|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=U:\Production\Online%20Publisher\Images\train_critical.png&ver=1590174660317)|The following exercise assumes that you have done all the steps and In-Class Exercises from the previous lessons. If you have not, this exercise may not work as written.|

##### Part 1: Labels for Bulk Products

Let’s set up the label printing that will be needed for the bulk medications dispensed from our central pharmacy. For these meds, you’ll need labels for first doses and redispenses. The labels should have barcodes for pharmacy tracking.

1. Open your trn3## Central Pharmacy record

- Hint: **Classic >> Pharmacy Admin**

1. Select the Label Routing form.
2. For bulk products:

- For these actions: Dispense (First Dose), PRN Par Dispense (First Dose), and Redispense
- Print this label: RX LABEL – BULK [40849701011]
- To this printer: TRN CENTRAL 1ST DOSE/REDISPENSE [90000015]
- Tip: When entering multiple lines, you can use “=” in the Destination and SmartText fields to pull in the value from the previous row.

1. Review your Label Routing table.

- You should have 3 rows, one row for each action.
- For each row the **Action**, **Dispense Code**, **Order** **SmartText**, and **Destination** fields should be filled in.

1. Close your pharmacy record.

##### Part 2: Test Your Label Routing

1. In Hyperspace, open the Orders activity for your Kristi patient.
2. Discontinue any active orders.
3. Sign the following orders:

- LORAZEPAM 0.5 MG PO TABS [4572] (0.5 mg, q6h PRN)
- Your TRN3## GENTAMICIN eye drops (both eyes)

1. **Sign** both of these orders. Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider.

1. Go to the Medications activity. Select the active trn3## gentamicin order and click **Label Hx**.

- You should see a row with a print time, indicating that a label printed. What action caused the label to print? Dispense (First Dose)

1. Click **Reprint/Preview Labels** and preview the label.
2. After you’ve seen the label, close the preview and close Label Hx.
3. Back in the Medications activity click **Dispense**. Dispense another bottle of gentamicin eye drops from your trn3## Central Pharmacy.
4. Click **Label Hx**.

- Did another label print? What action caused the label to print? Yep! Redispense

1. Close Label History.
2. Back in the Medications activity, select the lorazepam order and try to click **Label Hx**.

- Have labels printed for this order? Why not? (Read on to find the answer if you’re not sure.) 

Nope. Lorazepam's dispense code is Unit Dose, and we haven't added any Unit Dose rows to the Label Routing table...yet!

##### If You Have Time: Labels for Unit Dose Meds

Lorazepam is a unit dose medication and you haven’t set up label printing for that dispense code. Let’s fix that! This section will be less guided.

1. In Classic, go to Label Routing for your trn3## Central Pharmacy.
2. For First Doses, PRN First Doses and Redispenses of unit dose products:

- Print this label: RX LABEL – UNIT DOSE [4084970101]
- To this printer: TRN CENTRAL 1ST DOSE/REDISPENSE [90000015]
- All dispenses of a unit dose order that happen at the same time should be placed in one envelope. Only a single label should print, no matter how many doses are dispensed at one time. (Hint: configure the **Group?** column.)

1. Close the pharmacy record.
2. Back in Hyperspace, modify Kristi’s current lorazepam order, changing the frequency to Q8H PRN.
3. **Sign**. Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider.
4. Confirm that one label has printed for all three dispenses. (Hint: Check **Label Hx** for the active lorazepam order.)

### Printing Labels for Carts

In the last lesson, you configured a cart for IVs and syringes. The cart is not configured to print reports like your unit dose cart was. Instead, doses that should go on the IV and syringe cart should print labels.

Printing labels for cart doses is not configured in the CRT record. Labels are set up on the pharmacy (PHR) record’s Label Routing table.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637262669212718367.png&ver=1590706121363)

Pharmacy Admin: Setting up dose labels for carts and batches

The actions which will cause a label to print at the Finalize time of a cart (CRT) record are:

- Dispense (Cart Fill)
- PRN Par Dispense (Cart Fill)

### Sending Labels to the Dispense Queue

The Dispense Queue is an activity in Hyperspace where technicians can find and sort doses that need to be prepared, and print labels for those doses on demand. You can send labels for cart doses to the Dispense Queue instead of printing them automatically at the Finalize time. You can also send labels for redispenses and first doses to the Dispense Queue instead of printing them automatically when they are dispensed.

When a user prints a dose from the Dispense Queue, the system prints a label based on configuration in the Label Routing table.

#### Sending Cart Doses to the Dispense Queue

**Path: Cart (CRT) Record >> Cart Schedule form**

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638452283041885033.png&ver=1709674704183)

#### Sending First Doses and Redispenses to the Dispense Queue

The setting in the Cart (CRT) record only sends doses scheduled to that batch/cart to the Dispense Queue. If first doses and redispenses should go to the Dispense Queue, indicate that in the pharmacy record.

**Path: Rx Admin >> Pharmacy Admin >> Pharmacy (PHR) record >> Dispense Queue form**

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637474245902817024.png&ver=1611870990290)

To exclude 1st first doses, clear the **Include 1st First Doses labels…** check box on the Dispense Queue form. To exclude PRN par dispense first doses, add rows to Dispense Queue Settings table with a dispense type of First Dose (PRN frequency), the Dispense Code you would like to affect, and “No” in the **Queue?** column.|

#### Exercise 2: Send Cart Labels to the Dispense Queue

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|The pharmacy’s IV Room Batch runs and all doses are sent to the dispense queue. When the technician prints the label, the system will check the pharmacy’s Label Routing table for an action of “Dispense (Cart Fill)” to see what should print.|

##### Part 1: Set up Queued Cart Labels

1. In Classic use **Rx Admin** >> **Pharmacy Admin** to open your trn3## Central Pharmacy. Then go to the Label Routing form.
2. Whenever a Dispense (Cart Fill) action occurs for an IVPB Mixture, print these two labels:

- RX LABEL – PIGGYBACK MIXTURE and RX LABEL – PIGGYBACK PRODUCTION. The production label will act as a recipe card for the technician preparing the IV Piggyback, while the other label will be affixed to the mixture.
- Print both labels to the TRN CENTRAL IV printer.
- In the production label row, say Yes to Group? This will ensure that we only print one “recipe card” even if the patient needs multiple doses.

1. Whenever a Dispense (Cart Fill) action occurs for an IVPB Premix, print the label called RX LABEL – PIGGYBACK PREMIX to the printer TRN CENTRAL IV.

- You don’t need to print a production label for premixes because they are ready to use.

1. Whenever a Dispense (Cart Fill) action occurs for a Syringe, print these two labels:

- RX LABEL – SYRINGE and RX LABEL – SYRINGE PRODUCTION.
- Print both labels to the TRN CENTRAL IV printer.
- Make sure only one production label prints no matter how many doses a patient needs.

1. Check that you have added five new rows to your label routing table. If not, revisit the last several steps.
2. Close your pharmacy record.
3. In Cart Admin, open your TRN3## IV BATCH.
4. On the **Cart Schedule** form, check the box for **Queue dispenses**.

- This will prevent your labels from being automatically printed. Instead, they will be held in the Dispense Queue until they are manually sorted and printed.

1. Click **Reset Cart** (HINT: Look at the bottom of your screen). Yes, you're sure.

- In the last lesson, you finalized your IV cart when testing it. To allow us to test the cart again today, we must reset it.

1. Click **Accept** to save your changes and close your cart record.

##### Part 2: Test Your Cart Labels

1. In Hyperspace as your pharmacist, place the following order for your Kristi patient: ampicillin IV/IM [420002] (q4h Scheduled) and click **Sign & Verify**.

- Select "Telephone with Readback" and select Kristi's attending provider.

1. Look at the ampicillin order in Verify Orders.

- What is the dispense code? IVPB Mixture
- Based on that dispense code, will labels be produced when this medication is dispensed via your cart? Yes

1. **Verify** the ampicillin. Override any warnings.
2. In Classic as your administrator, run your TRN3## IV BATCH cart.

- HINT: **Pharmacy >> Cart Fill >>** Select your **"TRN3## Central Pharmacy" >>** Open your **"TRN3## IV BATCH"** cart **>> Finalize** (bottom right corner)

1. In Hyperspace, return to Kristi’s chart and try to open Label Hx for the active ampicillin order.

- Did labels print? Nope! But we didn’t want them to. We sent the labels to the Dispense Queue instead.

1. In the **Pharmacy** menu, select **Dispense Queue**. 
2. Select your trn3## Central Pharmacy and click **Accept**.
3. Choose a Dispense Type of **Cart Fills**.
4. There should be at least one ampicillin IVPB dose in the queue. Select all of them at the same time, and click **Print Selected**. Close the Dispense Queue.
    - Note: Don’t select and print them one at a time. If you do, your production labels won’t be grouped!
5. Open Label Hx for your ampicillin order in Kristi’s chart. You should see that only one production label printed. There should be one mixture label for each ampicillin order you found in the Dispense Queue.

In addition to setting up label routing, you may also be interested in how you can configure labels and printers. For more information refer to the following sections of the [_Medication Labels Setup and Support Guide_](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=1608154) found on Galaxy:

- "Design Labels"
- “Make Label Printers Available in Hyperspace”

### Reviewing the Chapter

Review Questions

1. Name three actions that can generate label printing.

Dispense (first dose), PRN Par Dispense (first dose) and Redispense are a few.

1. True or False: If you leave the **Dispense Code** column blank for an action in the Label routing table, that action will never cause any labels to print.

False. It will print for ANY medication when that action is triggered, regardless of dispense code.

1. True or False: You must assign a **Dispense Code** to every medication (ERX) on your central pharmacy medication list.

False. In System Definitions, Unit Dose is the default Dispense Code. Therefore, in each unit dose ERX record, you can leave Dispense Code blank.

1. What is the purpose of the **Group?** column?

You want to indicate “yes” to Group? when only one label should print regardless of how many doses are being dispensed for an order at that time. In other words, grouping labels causes all of the doses to be represented by a single label.

1. True or False: Cart Labels are configured in CRT records.

False. Cart Labels are configured in the cart’s parent pharmacy record using the actions Dispense (Cart Fill) and PRN Par Dispense (Cart Fill).

## 6. Configuring Dispense Logic

### Introduction

As you learned in RX100, Epic automatically determines a dispense location for an order based on:

- The patient’s unit
- The dispense locations (pharmacy records) that dispense to that unit, in order of preference, and…
- What medications are available in each dispense location, as defined by the medication list record attached to each one.

This chapter discusses how to configure the logic, and how to build exceptions into the logic.

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able to…

- Configure the list of available pharmacies for a unit
- Predict which dispense locations Epic will choose for a given order
- Define exceptions for how the system picks a dispense location

### Configuring Basic Dispense Logic

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|The following assumes that you’ve done all the steps and In-Class Exercises from the previous lessons. If you have not, these steps may not work as written.|

#### Configure the Pharmacies Serving Your Unit

Epic will choose a dispense location based on the pharmacies that serve a patient's unit, and the order in which they are listed. Epic will choose the first listed pharmacy that can dispense the ordered medication.

**Path: Rx Admin >> Unit/Department Admin >> Dispensing Information form**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|The 3 North unit on your class info sheet is served by the following:<br><br>- The unit’s floor stock, which contains a handful of maintenance fluids as well as insulin.<br>- An ADS cabinet, which carries a number of unit-dose meds.<br>- The Oncology Satellite Pharmacy, which is actually a few floors away from your 3 North unit, but which dispenses the majority of chemotherapy medications to patients throughout the hospital.<br>- Your hospital’s central pharmacy.|

In Classic, open your trn3## 3 North Unit to the **Dispensing Information** form

In the "Pharmacies that dispense to this unit" table, enter the following dispense locations in this order:

- TRN3## 3 North Floor Stock
- TRN3## 3 North ADS
- TRN3## Oncology Satellite Pharmacy
- TRN3## Central Pharmacy

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638491195852778220.png&ver=1713558785270)

#### Predict Which Dispense Location Epic Will Choose

Let’s review how Epic picks a dispense location:

- The system considers the pharmacies you listed, in the order listed, as dispense locations for any order placed for a patient in your unit.
- The system only dispenses from a pharmacy that has the medication on the medication list (EFY) record attached to the pharmacy (PHR) record.
    - The NDCs on the list determine which package dispenses.
- If no pharmacies stock the medication, the system still selects your hospital’s main pharmacy, typically Central Pharmacy, but there will be no package selected.

Make a prediction about where each medication will dispense from and what package will be used, using these steps:

- Highlight the first Pharmacy and click **Open Record.**
- From the PHR record, select **Open...** next to the **Medication list** field.
- Look for the medications below. If you find them:
    - Write down the pharmacy and package that will dispense.
- Repeat steps 1-3 for the next pharmacy listed.

|**This Medication:**|**Should dispense from this pharmacy:**|**Should use this package (NDC):**|
|---|---|---|
|Dextrose-NaCl 5-0.9 % IV soln [15882]|3-North Floor Stock|0264-7610-00, 1000 mL flex cont|
|Insulin regular human 100 unit/mL IJ soln [10289]|3-North Floor Stock|0002-8215-01, 10 mL vial|
|Morphine sulfate 4 mg/mL IJ soln [5172]|3-North ADS|76045-005-11, 1 mL syringe|
|Rituximab 100 mg/10 mL IV soln [129647]|Oncology Satellite|50242-051-21, 10 mL vial|
|Famotidine 10 mg PO tabs [15065]|Central Pharmacy|68001-494-04, 30 each bottle|
|Cetirizine HCl 10 mg PO tabs [9506]  <br>_HINT: read bullet points above if you’re not sure!_|Central Pharmacy  <br>(comes from central because it's the hospital's main pharmacy, but has no ERX or NDC on the med list)|None; "Medication not on med list"|

In Hyperspace, open Kristi's chart to the Orders activity. In the **Place orders and order sets** field, search for "Rx Dispense 1" and compare the dispense location and package listed in each Order Composer to your predictions.

- If you see the search results window, select “RX DISPENSE LOGIC – EXERCISE 1 - CHECK YOUR WORK” from the Database tab.

|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|If Epic cannot find a medication at any of the listed pharmacies, the “main” pharmacy (set in the Hospital record) is selected as the dispense location. However, a package (NDC) is not selected. A pharmacist must manually select a package before the order can be verified.|

### In-Class Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Configuring Exceptions to Dispense Logic

In the last exercise you explored basic dispense logic. In reality, there are many exceptions to medications dispensing from various locations. Let’s explore them.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|The trn3## 3 North ADS has limited space. It only dispenses:<br><br>- PRN medications<br>- First Doses<br>- Narcotics<br><br>Nurses can get the doses they need right away while other medications come from the satellite pharmacy or central pharmacy.|

##### Part 1: Limiting Your ADS Cabinet to Only PRN Medications

1. Search for and select a new order for LORAZEPAM 0.5 MG PO TABS [4572] for Kristi. In the Order Composer, select the following frequencies. Where is the order dispensing from with each of these frequencies?

|**Frequency**|**Dispense Location**|
|---|---|
|Every 4 Hours PRN|3-North ADS|
|Every 4 Hours|3-North ADS|

- Uh-oh. The ADS should only dispense medications ordered with a PRN frequency. Let's fix that!

1. In Classic, open your trn3## 3 North unit and go to the **Dispensing Information** form.

- Hint: **Rx Admin** >> **Unit/Department Admin**

1. Go to the ADS row and restrict it to just PRN medications

- Hint: Say “yes” to Only PRN?

1. Switch to the General form of the record so that your changes are saved.
2. In Hyperspace, go back to the Orders activity for Kristi.
3. Open the order composer for the lorazepam. Where is the order dispensing from for these frequencies now?

|**Frequency**|**Dispense Location**|
|---|---|
|Every 4 Hours PRN|3-North ADS|
|Every 4 Hours|Central Pharmacy|

- The “Every 4 Hours” order (a non-PRN frequency) no longer dispenses from the ADS.

##### Part 2: Allowing First Doses to Come from the ADS

Next let’s get First Doses dispensing from the cabinet.

1. Look at your lorazepam order with a frequency of q4h.

- Where are most doses dispensing from (Dispense from field)? Central Pharmacy First doses? Central Pharmacy
- Nurses should get first doses from the ADS instead!

1. Leave this order here, and back in your trn3## 3 North unit record return to the **Dispensing Information** form.
2. In the ADS row, click the magnifying glass in the **Dose Types** column.

- If blank, all doses can come from this pharmacy.

1. Restrict the ADS to first doses only.
2. Switch to a different form in your unit record and in Hyperspace, go back to Kristi’s chart.
3. Look at the dispense section for your lorazepam order.

- Make sure the **Frequency** is “q4h.”
- Are the first doses coming from your ADS? No     
- Review your dispense logic. Can you guess why not?

The ADS can only dispense first doses of PRN orders.

1. Change the frequency to q4h PRN. Are the first doses coming from your ADS? Yes   

- If you fill in two fields in the same row, the system uses **AND** logic: only dispense from the ADS if it is a first dose _and_ a PRN order.
- To dispense from the ADS if it’s a PRN order _or_ it’s a first dose, we need two rows in dispense logic.

1. Back in Classic, return to the **Dispensing Information form** in your unit record and remove the first doses only setting from your ADS row.
2. Add a new row for the ADS and restrict it to first doses only.

- This line should be next to your other ADS row.
- HINT: Use buttons on the bottom to move the row.
- You create **OR** logic by listing a pharmacy multiple times. Each row has one column filled in. The lines must be adjacent.
- Remember to change to another form to see your changes in Hyperspace

1. Back in Hyperspace go to Kristi’s chart. Change the frequency _back_ to **q4h**.

- First doses are coming from the ADS and subsequent doses from central.

##### Part 3: Allowing All Doses of Narcotics to Come from the ADS

Most states require that narcotics be dispensed from a controlled, secure location (such as an ADS cabinet) to prevent theft or abuse. If you are restricting which frequencies or dose types can come from an ADS, you’ll probably make an exception for certain controlled medications.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|_Clinical Context: DEA Codes_<br><br>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration assigns controlled meds to the following “schedules” or “classes” (from most- to least-restricted):<br><br>- C-I: No accepted medical use.<br>    - Hospitals do not dispense these (they are illegal drugs).<br>- C-II: High abuse potential<br>    - Examples: morphine or oxycodone<br>- C-III: Moderate dependence<br>    - Examples: tranquilizers like ketamine or pentobarbital<br>- C-IV: Limited dependence<br>    - Examples: Hypnotic Ativan or sleep aid Ambien<br>- C-V: Limited abuse potential (mild narcotics)<br>    - Example: Cough syrups with a small amount of codeine<br><br>Uncontrolled medications (such as Tylenol, Lipitor, and insulin) are considered “non-scheduled” medications and are labeled as “C-0”.|

1. In Hyperspace, remove all of Kristi’s orders.
2. Enter (but do not sign) a new order for “5172” (a morphine injection).

- What is the default frequency? Where is it dispensing from?

q4h PRN; from the ADS

1. Change the **Frequency** to “Once” (_not_ PRN).

- Where are the first dose coming from? The subsequent doses?

First doses: from the ADS   Subsequent doses: Central pharmacy

- We want all morphine dispensing from the ADS, not just first doses.

1. In Classic, go back to your 3 North Unit record and back into the Dispensing Information form.

- The **Highest DEA code** field is a way to tell the system how to dispense controlled medications.
- This field can be confusing. Think of it as _the least restrictive DEA code_. The DEA code you enter and any codes that are _more_ restrictive will dispense from this location.
- Example: If you enter C-IV, then C-IV, C-III, and C-II medications can be dispensed from here.

1. Update your dispense logic so that the ADS dispenses doses that are PRN Doses _or_ first doses _or_ C-III (or more restrictive) narcotics.

- HINT: For **OR** logic, you need to create a new row next to your other ADS rows.

1. Switch to another form in your 3 North Unit record to save your changes.
2. In Hyperspace, remove the order for the morphine injection and place a new order for “Rx Dispense 2” for Kristi.
3. Select “RX DISPENSE LOGIC – EXERCISE 2 - CONTROLLED MEDS” from the Database tab.

- Write down the dispense locations for the following meds:

|**Order _(and DEA schedule)_**|**Dispense from:**|**First doses from:**|
|---|---|---|
|morphine injection, every 1 hour  <br>_(a C-II medication)_|3-North ADS|3-North ADS|
|acetaminophen-codeine (Tylenol w/ Codeine #3) 300-30 MG per tablet, Q6H _(a C-III medication)_|3-North ADS|3-North ADS|
|LORazepam (ATIVAN) tablet, Nightly _(a C-IV medication)_|Central Pharmacy|3-North ADS|

**Check your work:**

Note: The three ADS rows can be in any order as long as they are next to each other, after the floor stock, and before the oncology satellite pharmacy.

##### Part 4: Limiting Which Meds a Satellite Dispenses to Certain Units

Your Oncology Satellite pharmacy primarily serves the oncology unit, but it also dispenses chemotherapy medications to patients throughout the hospital. When serving other units, it should only dispense _chemotherapy_ medication, not any other medications that happen to be in stock.

1. In Hyperspace, remove any unsigned orders you have for Kristi.
2. Enter a new order for ONDANSETRON HCL 4 MG/2ML IJ SOLN [106348] (an anti-nausea medication). **Sign** the order (override any warnings you see.) Select telephone with readback and select Kristi's attending provider.

- Let’s use a troubleshooting tool to quickly figure out _where_ this medication is coming from and _why_.

1. Go to Order Hx for the ondansetron. (Hint: **Medications** >> highlight the order >> **Order Hx**.)
2. Click **Troubleshooting** **>> Dispense Trace** (if you don't see **Troubleshooting**, click the **More** button). 

- You’ll see a report like this:  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637262765687150626.png&ver=1590715768793)
- The satellite pharmacy should only dispense chemo meds to patients in your 3 North Unit. But ondansetron (an anti-nausea med) is on the Oncology Satellite Pharmacy med list, so the system chose to dispense from there.

1. In Classic, go back to the **Dispensing Information** form of your trn3## 3 North Unit record.
2. Select the row for your satellite pharmacy and click **Open Record**
3. From the PHR select **Open..****.** next to the **Medication list** field.

- Ondansetron is on the pharmacy’s med list, even though it’s not a chemotherapy medication.
- We can’t remove it, because the satellite should be able to dispense it to patients in the Oncology unit .
- Instead, we should change dispense logic specifically for your 3-North Unit.

1. Close the med list and the pharmacy record.
2. In the satellite pharmacy row back in your unit record, under **Limit to Medication List**, enter “TRN3## CHEMO MEDS” (replacing ## with your assigned number)![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638295112455136580.png&ver=1693950445493)
3. Click **Accept** to save your changes and close your unit record.
4. Open the TRN3## Chemo Meds list.

- **Rx Admin >> Medication List Admin**

1. In the table below, write "Yes" or "No" in the TRN3## Chemo Meds column to indicate whether that med is on Chemo Meds list.

- We’ve already filled in the Oncology Satellite column.
- You’ll fill in the “Dispenses…” column in a later step.
- HINT: Highlight the trn3## chemo meds list and click **Open** **Record**.

|**Orders**|**On the Med List?**|   |**Dispenses from Satellite?**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Oncology Satellite**|**TRN3## Chemo Meds**|
|rituximab 100 mg/10 mL solution _(a chemo med)_|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|ondansetron (Zofran) 4 mg/2mL injection _(a non-chemo, anti-nausea med)_|Yes|No|No|
|mitotane (Lysodren) tablet 500 mg _(a chemo med)_|No|Yes|No|

1. In Hyperspace, discontinue any active orders for Kristi and place a new order for “RX Dispense 2.” Select “RX DISPENSE LOGIC – EXERCISE 2 - ONCOLOGY MEDS.”
2. In the table above, write "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether it is dispensing from your TRN3## Oncology Satellite Pharmacy?
3. Based on what you’ve seen, how does the **Limit to Medication List** field work? A medication is dispensed from a pharmacy when… (pick one):
    1. The med is on EITHER the pharmacy’s med list OR the Limit To Med List.
    2. The med is on the Limit to Med List; it doesn’t matter if it’s on the pharmacy’s med list.
    3. The med is on BOTH the Limit to Med List AND the pharmacy’s med list.

Answer: C

#### If You Have Time: Document Your Findings

Use what you learned in the last two exercises to answer the following questions.

##### Exceptions to Dispense Logic

Use this screenshot with some hypothetical dispense logic to answer the questions below (and by the way, the “crash cart” example isn’t very realistic):

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638295115117223626.png&ver=1693950711720)

1. What best describes the first line? (pick ONE)  
      
    Orders dispense from the floor stock if the medication is available there and…
    1. It’s _either_ a first dose _or_ it’s on the Crash Cart medication list.
    2. It's _both_ a first dose _and_ it’s on the Crash Cart medication list.

Answer: B

1. Zolpidem (Ambien) is a C-IV controlled medication. Tablets are stocked in the ADS but not the Floor Stock.

  
True or False: If you order it with a Nightly (not PRN) frequency, it will dispense from the ADS.

Answer: False

1. Famotidine (Pepcid) tablets are stocked on the EMH Robot but NOT in floor stock or the ADS.  
      
    You order Pepcid tablets, BID, starting now. Where will the first dose come from? Subsequent (cart) doses?

First Doses:  from Central Pharmacy (because the robot only handles "cart" doses, not first doses; main pharmacy is the only option left).  Subsequent doses: from the robot.

#### If You Have Time: Make Further Predictions

Let’s test your understanding of how dispense logic works.

1. Open your trn3## 3 North unit record. Your dispense logic should look like the screenshot below. If not, update it![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638295115798689752.png&ver=1693950779850)
2. Using your pharmacies’ medication lists, predict where each medication will come from and _why_ you think that.

|**Order**|**Dispense Locations**|**Why You Think That**|
|---|---|---|
|Sodium chloride 0.9 % IV soln [27838]  <br>_100 ml/hr, continuous, intravenous_|Dispense from:<br><br>_Floor stock_<br><br>First doses from:<br><br>_Floor stock_|_Floor stock is listed first in the unit, and this medication is on its medication list._|
|Oxycodone-acetaminophen 7.5-300 mg PO tabs [76413]  <br>_A C-II scheduled med  <br>1 tablet, oral, Q8H scheduled_|Dispense from:<br><br>_ADS_<br><br>First doses from:<br><br>_ADS_|_This med is on the ADS med list and a C-II medication, so it’s covered by the 4th line._|
|Albuterol sulfate 2 mg PO tabs [253]  <br>_2 mg, oral, 4 Times Daily_|Dispense from:<br><br>_Central pharmacy_<br><br>First doses from:<br><br>_ADS_|_It’s on the ADS med list, but isn’t controlled or PRN. Only the 1st doses will come from the ADS, based on the 2nd line._|
|Diphenhydramine HCl 12.5 mg PO chew [15539]  <br>_12.5 mg, oral, Q6H PRN_|Dispense from:<br><br>_ADS_<br><br>First doses from:<br><br>_ADS_|_This med is on the ADS med list. It was ordered with a PRN frequency, so it’s covered by the 3rd line in your Unit._|
|Cyclophosphamide 25 mg PO caps [126404]  <br>_25 mg, oral, Daily_|Dispense from:<br><br>_Oncology satellite_<br><br>First doses from:<br><br>_Oncology satellite_|_It’s on BOTH the Oncology satellite’s med list AND on the Chemo Meds list._|
|Losartan potassium 25 mg PO tabs [14823]  <br>_50 mg, oral, Daily_|Dispense from:<br><br>_Central pharmacy_<br><br>First doses from:<br><br>_Central pharmacy_|_It’s not on the med lists for ANY of the pharmacies that serve your unit, so it has to come from central._|

1. Test your predictions. For Kristi, place a new order for “Rx Dispense”.
2. Select “RX DISPENSE LOGIC – IF YOU HAVE TIME”.
3. Compare each order to your prediction.
4. If any of your predictions were wrong, see if you can figure out why. If you can’t, ask your instructor for help.  
     

### Key Takeaways

Dispense logic is set up at the Unit level. Epic evaluates pharmacies in the order that they are listed.

Epic selects a pharmacy as a dispense location if:

- The medication is stocked at the pharmacy (on the med list) _and..._
- There are no restrictions preventing it.

If Epic cannot find the medication at any listed pharmacy, the main pharmacy (in your Hospital record) is selected.

- If no NDC is selected at the main pharmacy, pharmacists must select one manually during verification.

#### Adding Restrictions

You may wish to restrict _when_ a medication is dispensed from a pharmacy. You can do this by configuring the rows to the right of the **Pharmacy** column in the dispense logic table.

- Multiple restrictions in one row have **AND** logic.
- To create **OR** logic:
    - Create multiple adjacent rows for a pharmacy
    - Configure one restriction per row

You can add the following restrictions to a dispense location:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Dose Types|“First Doses Only” can only be the **First doses from** location<br><br>“Cart Doses Only” can only be the **Dispense from** (primary) location<br><br>Blank = can dispense all doses|
|Only PRN?|“Yes” = can dispense only PRN orders<br><br>“No” = can dispense only non-PRN orders<br><br>Blank = can dispense either PRN or non-PRN orders|
|Limit to Medication List|Only dispense medications on the **Limit to…** med list AND the pharmacy’s med list.|
|Highest DEA Code|Think of it as _least restrictive DEA code_. Only dispense medications with this DEA code or a _more_ restrictive DEA code.|

### Beyond the Basics: Configuring Routing Departments by Phases of Care

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|The following information is considered beyond the basics. It may be of interest to you but it is not required.|

Epic's _Phases of Care_ functionality is designed to help providers designate certain orders as intended for a specific portion of a patient's care.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|A provider prepares a patient’s post-op orders prior to surgery. The nurse releases those orders when the patient reaches the recovery room. This ensures the orders are active at the appropriate time.|

Routing departments are used to dispense medications to locations other than those to which the patient is currently admitted (according to Epic’s ADT application).

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|A patient is admitted to a bed in 3 North, but his procedure is done elsewhere. Your pre-op routing department dispenses any necessary drugs to the patient’s current location.|

You map phases of care to hospitals and departments in System Definitions.

**Path: Clinical Administration >>** **Management Options >> Edit System Definitions >> Medication, Allergy, Imm, etc. >> General Options >> Phases of Care Routing screen**

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637262787424017752.png&ver=1590717942467)

In order for Pharmacists to change Phases of Care and routing department during verification, you must enable it in Pharmacy System Definitions.

**Path: Rx Admin >> System Definitions >> Dispensing form**

- Select the box “Enable phase of care in verification”.
- Select the box “Enable routing department in verification”.

### Reviewing the Chapter

Review Questions

1. A Pharmacy (PHR) record’s Medication List (EFY) record tells the system which medications can be dispensed from there. The Medication List (EFY) record also determines which specific _______ will be dispensed from that pharmacy.

Package (NDC)

1. True or False: If a medication is not on your central pharmacy’s medication list, the system won’t dispense the medication from there.

False. The hospital’s central pharmacy is the “dispense location of last resort.”

1. What happens if a medication is dispensed from your central pharmacy, but it isn’t on the central pharmacy’s medication list? What field is missing?

The Package field will be blank. A pharmacist will have to manually select a package to verify the order.

1. Which of these is the best description of what the limit the Limit to Medication List field does (pick ONE only)?  
      
    Epic will dispense medications from the associated pharmacy if the meds are:
    1. Not on the **Limit to…** list.
    2. On the **Limit to…** list.
    3. On both the **Limit to…** list and the pharmacy’s med list.

C) The medication has to be on BOTH lists for Epic to consider dispensing from that pharmacy.

1. What can I use to quickly find information about why a medication is dispensing incorrectly?

From Order Hx, I can click Troubleshooting>>Dispense Trace, and read the report.

Study Checklist

## 7. Configuring Floor Stock Pharmacies

### Introduction

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able to…

- Identify the main traits of a floor stock pharmacy
- Identify the differences between a floor stock pharmacy and the central pharmacy record
- Correctly configure a floor stock pharmacy

### Configuring Floor Stock Pharmacies

Most units have floor stocks where nurses can get common medications. It could be anything from a shelf in the nursing station to a sophisticated closet requiring keycard access. Regardless of the details, a “floor stock” pharmacy in Epic has the following traits:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Labels?|No!|_Nurses take what they need from floor stock. No labels needed._|
|Redispensing?|No!|_Not from this location. Redispensing is another way to tell Epic to print a label._|
|Interface?|No!|_No way to communicate with Epic. Medications from floor stock never have a ‘dispense’ action in Epic._|
|First and Cart Doses?|No!|_Nurses take what they need. Epic does not need to calculate first doses and cart fill doses._|

#### In-Class Exercise: Floor Stock Scavenger Hunt

In the following exercise, you’ll order a medication dispensed from floor stock and then explore the configuration in the pharmacy record that controls what you see.

##### Part 1: See Floor Stock in Action

1. Log in to Hyperspace as your pharmacist.
2. Order dextrose 5% infusion [2364], 100 mL/hr for your Kristi patient.
3. Click **Sign & Verify**. Select telephone with readback and select Kristi's attending provider.
4. Confirm that your order is dispensing from Floor Stock. **Verify** the order.

1. Go to the Medications activity. Are you able to click **Label Hx?**

- No label printed, does that make sense? Is there usually a label printer in Floor Stock?

1. Now, click **Order Hx**.

- Look in the **Action Type** column. Is there a dispense action?
- Nope, there’s just a Verify action. Does that make sense?

1. Click **Dispense**.

- Try to select your TRN3## 3 North Floor Stock as a dispense location.
- It’s not there. The system won’t let you redispense from floor stock.
- Why can’t you redispense?

1. Click **Cancel.**

##### Part 2: See How Floor Stock Locations Are Built

1. In Classic, open your “TRN3## 3 North Floor Stock” pharmacy. (Hint: **Classic >>** **Rx Admin >> Pharmacy Admin**.)

- Find the **Type** field. Does this PHR record have the same type as your TRN### central pharmacy record? Yes    
- What setting on the General form told Epic that the D5 for Kristi’s order is stocked in Floor Stock?

Medication list

1. You saw in Part 1 that no labels print from this pharmacy. How does the system know that you do NOT need labels for this pharmacy? (Hint: Check **Label Routing**. It’s blank!)
2. Go to the **Dispensing Information** form.

- Remember how Kristi’s D5 only had a Verify action, and we couldn’t redispense from floor stock? Which setting on this form is causing that?

The **Do not redispense from this Pharmacy** check box is selected.

1. Go to the **Others** form. What setting prevents first dose and cart fill dispenses?

The **Fire dispensing extension only (i.e. no first doses, no carts)** option is selected.

1. What is the value for the **Dispensing (often used for ADS)** item?

RX NO ORDER TO CABINET (FLOOR STOCK)

- This field is normally used for ADS cabinets.
- This setting doesn’t _do_ anything, really, except prevent an error when Epic tries to send a message to an ADS cabinet that doesn’t exist.

1. That’s it! You’ve found all the settings that caused the behaviors we saw in part one!

#### Key Takeaways

Floor stock pharmacies are configured similar to other pharmacies, with the following exceptions:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Prevent Labels|Do not fill out the **Label Routing** table|
|Prevent Redispensing|**Dispensing Information** form:<br><br>Check **Do not redispense from this Pharmacy**.|
|Prevent First Doses & Cart Fill|**Others** form:<br><br>Select **Fire dispensing extension only (i.e., no first doses, no carts)** and enter an extension (LPP) record in the **Dispensing (often used for ADS)** field. <br><br>Otherwise, orders from this location get a "Dispense (First Dose)" action when verified, which can cause erroneous charges.|
|No Interface Messages|**Others** form:<br><br>**Dispensing (often used for ADS):** enter “RX NO ORDER TO CABINET (FLOOR STOCK)” [85505]. This extension doesn't do anything, but the field must be populated if you want **Fire dispensing extension only (i.e. no first doses, no carts****)** to work. <br><br>The other option is "RX SEND ORDER TO CABINET," which adds orders from this location to the patient's ADS profile. See the next chapter for details.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|_Ward Stock in European/Australian Hospitals_<br><br>In the majority of European and Australian hospitals, nurses get most of their patients' medications from a medication room on the ward. This includes unit dose and bulk medications, as well as many injections, oral liquids, and IVs that require preparation. The Pharmacy (PHR) records for these "ward stocks" are configured more like satellite pharmacies: the _do_ typically have label printers, they _do_ allow for manual redispensing (and in fact, often allow nurses to trigger them directly from the MAR), and they _might_ use Cart (CRT) records to populate a Dispense Queue that nurses use to manage prepared labels. <br><br>If you work with a European/Australian organization, your Epic staff will help you configure these records appropriately.|

### Reviewing the Chapter

Review Questions

1. In your own words, describe what you would need to do in order to create and configure a PHR record for a floor stock pharmacy.

Your answer needs to include the following steps in order to be complete:

## 8. Configuring ADS Cabinets

### Introduction

Many organizations dispense a large number of medications from Automated Dispensing System (ADS) cabinets. You might have multiple ADS cabinets on one unit, and you might want to load certain medications into an ADS cabinet if an order is placed for those medications and they are not currently loaded. This chapter explores those configurations.

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able to…

- Explain how configuring an ADS cabinet PHR record differs from a standard PHR record
- Configure an ADS cabinet PHR record
- Configure a “Load to ADS” dispense location

### Configuring an ADS Cabinet Pharmacy Record

Each ADS cabinet in your hospital requires its own Pharmacy (PHR) record and Med List (EFY). You will configure the PHR record similar to a floor stock pharmacy.

||**Floor Stock**|**ADS**|
|---|---|---|
|Type:|Standard|Automated Dispensing Station|
|Labels?|No!|No!|
|Redispensing?|No!|No!|
|Interface?|No!|YES!|
|First and Cart Doses?|No!|No!|

In Classic, open your TRN3## 3 North ADS (replacing ## with your assigned number) PHR record.

- **Rx Admin >> Pharmacy Admin**

Configure the **General** form in the following way:

- Nurses see “3 North ADS” on the MAR.
- Confirm that:
    - It has the appropriate **Type**.
    - It doesn’t dispense prescriptions.
    - It is in your trn3## Hospital.
    - It is linked to your TRN3## 3 NORTH ADS MED LIST (replacing ## with your assigned number).

Prevent users from redispensing from this dispense location. (Hint; Use the **Dispensing Information** form.)

Prevent the system from creating first doses and cart fills for this dispense location. (Hint: Use the **Others** form.)

#### Configuring Interface Messages

Epic receives and sends messages over an interface to the ADS, some of which are affected by settings in the Pharmacy (PHR) record. These messages trigger different actions in Epic or the ADS,

|Outgoing Messages|Incoming Messages|
|---|---|
|**Order Verified**  <br>_Sends order to the ADS system, which updates the profile. Now, nurses can dispense a dose from any cabinet which serves that patient._|**Order Dispense**  <br>_Creates “ADS Dispense” action in Epic._<br><br>**Load/Unload**  <br>_Adds/Removes medication from medication list (EFY) record.  <br>Re-evaluates dispense logic for orders for this medication._|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|Other interface messages that involve the ADS system, like ADT messages, are configured elsewhere. Talk to your Epic representative or find more information in the [Willow Inpatient Interfaces Strategy Handbook](https://galaxy.epic.com/?#Browse/page=1!68!625!1770188), which is available on Galaxy.|

##### Outgoing Messages

When a medication is verified with an ADS dispense location, Epic sends the Order Verified message to the ADS console. Settings in the ADS system then add the medication to the patient’s profile at the appropriate ADS cabinets.

**Path: Pharmacy Record >> Others form**

Enter “RX SEND ORDER TO CABINET” in the **Dispensing (often used for ADS)** field.

- Epic does _not_ tell the ADS system the specific cabinet the medication should be dispensed from. Nurses can pull the order from any cabinet that has the med in stock and from which they can access the patient’s profile.

##### Incoming Messages

Incoming messages include an _identifier_ that reflects the specific ADS involved. Epic looks for a Pharmacy (PHR) record with an identifier that matches the one in the message.

If Epic can _NOT_ find a Pharmacy (PHR) record with a matching identifier, the interface message will error out, then:

- The ADS cabinet’s Medication List (EFY) record won’t reflect what’s currently loaded into the cabinet.
- Dispenses from this cabinet will never appear in Epic.
- Override pulls from this cabinet won’t appear on patients’ MARs.

**Path: Pharmacy Record >> ADS Settings** form

Enter “TRN3##_3_NORTH_ADS_1” in the **Dispensing Cabinet identifiers** field. _(Replacing ## with your assigned number)._

- In the real world, this value is supplied by your interface administrators.

Select the **Automatically change dispense location in response to automated dispensing station/robot load/unload** check box.

- With this setting, the system re-evaluates the dispense location for current orders after an ADS load or unload.  
     

##### Identifying Medications in Interface Messages

Your ADS system will have a catalog of medication products, similar to the ERX master file in Epic. Whenever a medication is loaded, unloaded, dispensed, or returned to/from an ADS cabinet, the interface message will include an identifier for that medication product. For example, your ADS system might have a product for “normal saline 100 mL” with an identifier of “NS100”.

Whenever Epic receives a message about “NS100,” it needs to figure out which record that is in Epic. This done by assigning Identity IDs (or “IID”). “Identity” is Epic’s solution for mapping records in Epic to records in non-Epic systems. Any given record can have multiple Identity IDs. For example, an ERX record might have one IID for communicating with ADS systems and a different IID for interfacing with a non-Epic billing system. For ADS systems, you set IIDs for most solid-form medications (tablets, capsules, etc.) in the appropriate ERX record. For medications dispensed as a package, you’ll typically set the IID in the NDC Grouper (a group of NDCs for a given ERX that all have a similar package size, and maybe package description). You can technically set an IID for a specific NDC, but that is rarely done.

IIDs can be assigned to ERXs manually (**Classic >> Rx Admin >> Medication Admin >> open record >> Identity/ADS form >> ID Maintenance**). Or, you can import them from a build spreadsheet. The same is true for NDC Groupers.

It is critical that every medication product in your ADS be mapped to an appropriate ERX or NDG in Epic. It is also important that your ADS system has a medication product that represents every ERX and NDG that might ever be loaded to an ADS cabinet or added to a patient’s profile. If this mapping is not done (or isn’t done correctly), your end-users will experience all sorts of problems.

You can easily review assigned IIDs via the Medication List activity. The ADS tab includes a column showing the ADS IID that will apply to each NDC on the list, and where that IID is set.

Open the medication list for your TRN3## 3 NORTH ADS and look at the **ADS** tab.

### In-Class Exercises

In Willow Inpatient Fundamentals, you learned the system can identify medications that _should_ be dispensed from an ADS cabinet but are not currently loaded. When one of these medications is ordered and verified, the following happens:

- An “ADS Load Label” prints in the central pharmacy, alerting technicians to load the medication in the ADS cabinet.
- The MAR displays a dispense location of “Pharmacy to Load in ADS.”
- The patient’s profile is updated in the ADS system (because the Order Verify interface message was triggered).

|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=U:\Production\Online%20Publisher\Images\train_example.png&ver=1342259274733)|Your TRN3## Hospital has determined that a short list of controlled medications should always dispense from an ADS cabinet. If one of these medications is not currently loaded, pharmacy should be notified to load it. Nurses should see a message on the MAR that it will be loaded by pharmacy, and be able to find the patient's profile on the cabinet (even before the medication is loaded). You need to configure this to work in your trn3## 3 North Unit, where Kristi is admitted.|

#### Exercise 1: Configuring an ADS Load Pharmacy

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|This exercise is less guided. Refer to these previous lessons as needed:<br><br>Lesson 2 - Building Pharmacies<br><br>Lesson 3 - Managing Medications Lists<br><br>Lesson 5 - Setting up Label Printing<br><br>Lesson 6 - Configuring Dispense Logic|

Create a Pharmacy Record

1. In classic create a new pharmacy record called “trn3## Load to ADS”.
2. Make it appear as “Pharmacy to load in ADS” on the MAR.
3. Give it a type of “Standard”.
4. Prevent it from filling prescriptions.
5. Make it part of your trn3## Hospital.
6. Link it to your trn3## Central Pharmacy med list.

- By linking the central pharmacy med list to your Load to ADS pharmacy, you are indicating that any medication that is available in your hospital but not loaded in ADS cabinets should be loaded in a cabinet before dispensing. That’s not right. Only certain medications should be loaded. You’ll see how we narrow down the central pharmacy med list soon.

1. Configure label routing:

- Labels print for two actions: verify and order transfer.
- Labels print for ALL medications (Hint: It's okay to leave Dispense Code blank!).
- Label: RX LABEL – ADS LOAD LABEL
- Printer: TRN CENTRAL 1ST DOSE/REDISPENSE.

1. You shouldn’t be able to redispense.
2. First doses and cart fills shouldn’t be generated.
3. Orders should be sent to the ADS system to update the cabinets.  
    _HINT: You need to use RX SEND ORDER TO CABINET_
4. Close your pharmacy record.

Define Medications that Should be Loaded

1. In Classic, create a new medication list called “trn3## Load to ADS Med List”.

- **Rx Admin >> Medication List Admin >> Create tab**

1. Add ACETAMINOPHEN-CODEINE 300-60 MG PO TABS [8950]

- There is no need to indicate which NDC is in stock. This medication list will be used to narrow down the central pharmacy med list to just the medications that should be stocked in the cabinets. You already linked the central pharmacy med list to the Load to ADS pharmacy, which has stocked NDCs on it.

1. Add DIAZEPAM 5 MG PO TABS [2405]
2. Add MORPHINE SULFATE 4 MG/ML IJ SOLN [5172]
3. Add OXYCODONE-ACETAMINOPHEN 2.5-325 MG PO TABS [10815]
4. Add FENTANYL CITRATE (PF) 50 MCG/ML IJ SOLN WRAPPED [4080003037]
5. Close your med list.

Update Dispense Logic

1. Still in Classic, open your TRN3## 3 North unit to the **Dispensing Information** form. List the Load to ADS pharmacy record just after any ADS cabinets that serve the unit.
2. In the Limit to Medication List column, link the medication list you just created.

- Now, medications that are on the central pharmacy med list AND the load to ads med list will need to be loaded in the cabinet. The NDCs will come from the central pharmacy med list, however, which means that you will not need to maintain an up-to-date list of NDCs on your load to ads med list. Efficiency!

##### Test Your Work!

1. Close all of your records and in Hyperspace go to the orders activity for Kristi.
2. Place an order for the “RX ADS LOAD MEDS” panel (find it on the Database tab).
3. Verify the **Dispense from** and **First doses from** fields for these orders:

- acetaminophen-codeine (Tylenol w/ Codeine #4) 300-60 MG per tablet [8950]  
    (a C-III medication)  
    **Dispense from:** TRN3## Load to ADS  
    **First doses from:** TRN3## Load to ADS
- morphine injection 4 mg [5172]  
    (a C-II medication)  
    **Dispense from:** TRN3## 3 North ADS  
    **First doses from:** TRN3## 3 North ADS
- diphenhydrAMINE (Benadryl) capsule [2509]  
    (a non-controlled medication)  
    **Dispense from:** TRN3## CENTRAL PHARMACY  
    **First doses from:** TRN3## CENTRAL PHARMACY
- Why does the Tylenol #4 come from the Load to ADS pharmacy?

It’s on the load to ads med list AND the central pharmacy med list.

1. If the dispense locations are correct, **Sign** these orders. (Override any warnings. Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider.)
2. Go to the MAR activity. Find the acetaminophen-codeine order.

- The **Dispense Location** is “Pharmacy to load in ADS.”

1. Go to Order Hx for the acetaminophen-codeine.
2. Confirm that you do NOT see a row with a PRN Par Dispense (First Dose) action.
3. Open Label Hx for the order.

- You should see that 1 label printed, with an Action of “Verify” and a label called “RX LABEL – ADS LOAD LABEL.” The destination should be “TRN CENTRAL 1ST DOSE/ REDISPENSE.

1. Close Kristi's chart. 

##### If You Have Time: Simulate Incoming Interface Messages

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|This section on simulating interface messages is _beyond the basics_. You might find it interesting or useful, but aren't expected to know it for the project or the exam.|

You just saw that an ADS Load Label printed when you verified an order for Tylenol #4. Now, pretend that you've just gone up to the 3 North ADS cabinet and loaded Tylenol #4 to an empty pocket.  Let's use a utility to simulate the load message from the ADS cabinet!

1. Log into Text.  If you're already logged in to Text, page up until you get back to the Training Application Access menu. 
2. From the Training Application Access menu, go to **Willow** (_not_ Clinical Administration) **>> Inpatient >> ADS >> Create Incoming Messages Utility >> Load**.
3. At the **Specification:** prompt, enter "334611" and press enter. 

- You're selecting an interface that's configured to process incoming Load/Unload/Dispense messages.  
- If you are prompted to "start the filer daemon?", enter "Yes".

1. At the **Pharmacy:** prompt, enter your TRN3## 3 NORTH ADS.
2. At the **Enter Selection:** prompt, enter "ERX".  Then, at the **Medication:** prompt, type "8950" and press enter.

- You'll see a summary, indicating that you're about to load acetaminophen-codeine 300-60 mg PO tabs to your 3 North ADS. 

1. Press enter to continue.

- You'll soon see an error message, indicating that the "LOAD UNLOAD USER COULD NOT BE FOUND."  This is expected! 

1. Press enter. 

- You've just simulated loading the medication to your ADS cabinet. Let's see what that did!

1. Leave Text open, but go to Classic. Go to **Rx Admin >> Medication List Admin** and open your TRN3## 3 NORTH ADS MED LIST. 

- Confirm that ACETAMINOPHEN-CODEINE 300-60 MG PO TABS [8950] is on the list. It was added by the system automatically in response to the load message. 
- Double-click that row to see which NDC is selected. Did you indicate that you were loading that NDC in the steps above?  No. 
- When the system added this ERX to your ADS med list, it automatically selected the same default NDC that was on your central pharmacy's medication list. The system assumes that are you loading the same package to your ADS cabinet.  

1. Close the medication list.
2. Go back to Hyperspace. If Kristi's chart is still open, close it. 
3. Re-open your Kristi patient's chart. Go to Order Hx for the acetaminophen-codeine order.

- Confirm that you now see an action for "Order Transfer," with a Pharmacy of your TRN3## 3 NORTH ADS. 
- This indicates that the dispense location has changed. The medication now longer needs to be loaded, it has _been_ loaded. The nurse can now get it from the ADS. 

1. Write down the ID number for this order, at the top of Order Hx (you'll need it in a moment): <number will vary> 
2. Go to the MAR activity and the find the acetaminophen-codeine order.

- The **Dispense Location** is now "3 North ADS."  Huzzah!

1. Now, let's pretend that the nurse just pulled the dose from the ADS. Go back to Text. 
2. In Text, you should be on the Create Incoming Messages Utility screen. Go to "Dispense". Enter the following:

- Do you want to use an interface?  Yes
- Specification:  334611
- Order:  <enter the ID number you wrote down in step 12>
- Enter selection:  Continue

1. You'll see a number of error messages; again, this is expected. Press enter.
2. Back in Hyperspace, go back to Order Hx for the acetaminophen-codeine order.

- You now see an additional action for the ADS Dispense, coming from your TRN### 3 NORTH ADS. 

1.  Close Order Hx.
2.  Back in Text, page up until you get back to the Training Application Access menu.  You're done!

#### Key Takeaways: Load to ADS Pharmacy

The Load to ADS workflow is made possible by creating an additional Pharmacy (PHR) record that does not actually represent a physical place. Load to ADS pharmacies have the following characteristics:

- Identifies medications that should always dispense from the ADS.
    - The central pharmacy med list (EFY) should be attached to the ADS load pharmacy (PHR).
    - Create another medication list—Load to ADS Med List—with just the medications that should be loaded in the ADS. Do not bother selecting any NDCs.
    - In the unit dispense logic, use the Limit to Medication List column to limit which medications on the central pharmacy med list should be considered for loading in the ADS. Do this by attaching the load to ADS med list that you created.
    - As a result, medications that are on the central pharmacy med list AND the load to ADS med list will have a dispense location of Load to ADS. The NDCs listed on the central pharmacy med list will be used. This prevents you from needing to update the NDCs on the load to ADS med list as different packages become available.
- Displays as “Pharmacy to Load in ADS” on the MAR
- Has a type of “standard”
- Does not allow redispenses
- Prints “ADS Load Label” to alert techs to load medication.
    - On the **Label Routing** form in the PHR record create rows for:
        - Verify
        - Order Transfer
    - Use “RX LABEL – ADS LOAD LABEL” and specify a printer
    - Leave the **Dispense Code** field blank.
- Initiates patient profile updates in the ADS
    - On the **Others** form in the PHR record.  
        **Dispensing (often used for ADS):** “RX SEND ORDER TO CABINET”
- Does not generate first doses and cart fills

### Reviewing the Chapter

Review Questions

Use the following word bank to fill in the blanks in questions 1-4. Use each word or phrase only once.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|- Order Verified<br>- Order Dispense<br>- Load/Unload|- Identifier<br>- RX SEND ORDER TO CABINET<br>- Medication List (EFY)|

1.  When a nurse “pulls” a dose of a medication from an ADS cabinet for a patient, the ADS system sends Epic a(n) ______________________message.

Order Dispense

1. When you verify an order in Epic with an ADS cabinet as its dispense location, the _______________________ interface message should be sent. This updates the patient’s profile in the ADS console. Epic knows to send this message because _____________________ is in the ADS cabinet’s pharmacy (PHR) record.

Order Verified, RX SEND ORDER TO CABINET

1. When a technician assigns a “pocket” in an ADS cabinet to a med, that medication is now considered “available” there. Epic receives a(n) _________________ interface message, which causes it to update the correct pharmacy (PHR) record’s ___________________record.

Load/Unload, Medication List (EFY)

1. In the previous question, the incoming message includes a string of text that indicates which physical ADS cabinet’s inventory changed. Epic uses the ______________ field to match that message with a specific pharmacy (PHR) record.

## 9: Building Inpatient Preference Lists

### Introduction

When you search for an order, you could potentially order any Medication (ERX), Procedure (EAP), or Order Panel (OSQ). That’s over 100,000 records, many of which wouldn’t be approved, available, or even configured for use.

Preference Lists help users find what they are looking for. Users have a **Preference List** and a **Facility List** tab when searching for orders. The system searches the **Preference List** tab first. The **Preference List** tab should include the orders they are most likely to use. For certain groups or specialties, users should be able to find what they’re looking for on the **Preference List** tab without having to sift through a large number of additional choices.

This chapter guides you through creating a medication preference list and assigning it to a specific group of users.

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able to…

- Describe the different “levels” of preference lists and how each is created
- Design and create a medication preference list
- Assign a medication preference list to a group of users

### The Preference List Tabs

When you search for an order, the system searches the **Preference List** tab first. If you want to see more results, you can expand your search to the Facility List.

#### What’s on the Preference List Tab?

The **Preference List** tab contains:

- All available order sets
- All orders on the Preference List (LPF) records in the most specific profile
- All the orders on your personal (self-made) preference lists

Log into Hyperspace as your physician: md## with a password of train. At the department prompt, select your **trn3## Critical Care** department.

- If you are prompted to select a team upon logging in, click cancel. 

In Patient Lists, find your Wayne patient, go to the Orders activity, and search for “AMI.”

Order Sets

All available Order Sets also appear on the **Preference List** tab (and on the **Facility List** and **Database** tabs, too). This happens automatically—there’s no Preference List (LPF) record that contains the Order Sets.

An “available” Order Set is one that is released for use and not otherwise restricted from appearing for the user or patient.

Profile Preference Lists

The majority of orders come from Preference List (LPF) records linked to a profile. You may have preference lists such as labs, meds, and patient care orders.

The system displays all preference lists from the most specific profile with any preference list values. Preference lists are attached to a profile in Text on the **Inpatient Orders Preference** **List** screen. Use the Session Information report to see which profiles affect a user. 

Right-click the **EpicCare** banner at the top right of Hyperspace. In the Session Information Report, expand **Profile Compilation**.

- Four profiles are affecting the physician: a security class level profile, a department level profile, a location level profile, and the System Definitions profile.

**TRAINER DEMO**: In Text, your Trainer will show the preference lists attached to the System Definitions profile.

- Because there are no preference lists in the other profiles affecting our MD user, all preference lists are coming from the System Definitions profile.

Personal Preference Lists

Users with the appropriate EpicCare security class settings to have the ability to create and edit their own personal preference lists. Add medications and procedures to a personal preference list by clicking the star icon in the Orders activity, or adding them in the Preference List Composer.

Items added to a personal preference list appear on the Preference List tab, alongside any orders on the profile-assigned preference lists.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|You’ll sometimes see Epic “suggest” an order as you type it. Epic tracks your ordering habits, and recognizes when you order something frequently. Such orders are moved to the top and appear with a lightbulb while searching. Learn more in the [Order Search Setup and Support Guide](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=100031412&PrefDocID=120341).|

#### What’s on the Browse Tab?

The **Browse** tab is a visual representation of what’s on the **Preference List** tab. Some users enjoy picking their orders off a list rather than searching for them.

The **Browse** tab is organized as follows:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637269478547095744.png&ver=1591387054727)

#### How Are Preference Lists Created and Assigned?

At a high level:

- Individual users create and maintain their own personal preference lists. These are automatically linked to each User (EMP) record.
- Profile preference lists are created manually by administrators and assigned to groups of users via profiles. The Inpatient Orders team does most of this build, but the Willow team creates any Preference List (LPF) records that contain medications.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|Specialty-specific physician preference lists should contain approx. 150 meds or fewer for efficient ordering. If you add more than 250 medications to a preference list, clinicians won’t be able to use the Browse tab. The Foundation System has several specialty preference lists to use as a starting point. Review those preference lists before creating new ones.|

### Designing a Profile Preference List

The Willow team is often responsible for creating and maintaining the profile preference lists that contain medications. That means you can ensure that the Preference List tab for physicians and nurses only includes medications that are approved and available.

Review Foundation System preference lists as a starting point. If you need to create a new preference list from scratch, use the following steps:

Step 1: Identify Your Audience

Determine—as specifically as you can—for whom this preference list will be. Is it for users in a particular department? A particular job role in that department? Will it apply to users working in multiple hospitals? If you can’t answer these questions, you won’t be able to finish this process.

Step 2: Choose and Organize the Appropriate Meds

Once you know your audience, you can start picking the appropriate medications. There are a few ways to do this:

- If your organization is already live, you could ask for Clarity reports that show the ordering patterns of your audience.
- If your audience isn’t using Epic yet, you might be able to get similar reports out of your current system(s). This requires a bit more work, because you’ll have to then “translate” those reports into Epic’s ERX records.
- If no reports are available, then you need to either do more research or make educated guesses.

Once you have your list of orders, assemble them into groupings of about 25 or fewer medications. These groupings will help “break up” the **Browse** tab into meaningful chunks.

Step 3: Identify Any Specific Default Values

When you add a Medication (ERX) record to a preference list, you can specify default values for an order that override settings in the ERX record. You can even add the same ERX record more than once with different default values.

Identify these preference-list specific defaults before you start building your preference list. Also consider whether you need to give them a different display name to reflect those default values.

Step 4: Determine How the Preference List Will Be Assigned

Profile preference lists are attached to groups of users via their profiles. But as you learned earlier, users can be affected by profiles attached at six different levels:

- User Template
- EpicCare Security Class
- Login Department
- Login Location
- Login Service Area
- System Definitions

Work with the Inpatient Orders team and your security coordinators to determine the correct strategy for assigning your preference list. While the System Definitions preference lists work for many users, specialized groups may have preference lists attached at a more specific level, like the department level.

If you have a preference list that applies to more than one group of users, you might have to attach it to more than one profile record.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637269480813845398.png&ver=1591387281403)

You only added a medications type preference list to the department level profile. That preference list will override the existing IP General Adult Meds preference list in the System Definitions profile. All other preference list types (labs, imaging, etc.) will still come from the System Definitions profile since we haven't specified them in our department level profile.

### In-Class Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Configuring an ICU Meds Preference List

In the following exercise, you will:

- Create a new Preference List (LPF) record for ICU medications (it will be an abbreviated list).
- Attach your new ICU meds Preference List (LPF) record to the Critical Care profile, which you'll then attach to your Critical Care Service login department.
- Test your work.

#### Part 1: Create an “ICU Meds” Preference List

You want your Critical Care physicians to have ICU-specific medications on their Preference List tab. That means you’ll need to create a Preference List (LPF) record for them.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|This exercise has you create a very (_very_) short and simple preference list. In the real world, it might have 100-150 medications.|

1. Log into Classic as your administrator.
2. Open the **Preference List Composer** activity.

- Click the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner (or CTRL + Spacebar) and search for **“Preference List Composer”**

1. At the bottom of the screen, click **Create New**.
2. The Preference List Properties window appears. Configure it like so:

- **Name:** TRN3## ICU MEDS
- **List type:** Orders
- **Sub type:** Order Panels
- **Ordering mode:** Inpatient
- We give the list a type of **Orders** so that we can include panels! The Meds type only allows adding ERXs. 

1. Click **Accept**.

- The first step is to establish your _sections_ and _subsections_. These will help organize the Browse tab for your users.

1. Create two sections: “IV Fluids” and “Drips”. (Hint: Case sensitive!)
2. Highlight the “IV Fluids” section and add two subsections: “Maintenance” and “Boluses”.

- Make sure Boluses is a subsection of IV Fluids, _not_ Maintenance. Hint: Drag and drop, if needed.

1. In the “Drips” section add two subsections “Antiarrhythmic” and “Pressors”.

- Make sure they are both at the same “level”.

1. Highlight the Maintenance subsection and add “Adult IV Maintenance Fluid Options”. 

- Hint: click **New Item** and type the name.
- This is a panel that contains many different IV fluid ERXs. You saw a similar one in RX100. Panels can make finding and ordering a specific fluid faster for providers.

1. Add the following medications under each of these subsections:

- Boluses:
    - sodium chloride 0.9 % bolus [400291]
        - Notice that an Order Composer appears. If you wanted, you could assign default values for this medication when ordered off of this preference list. Anything you leave blank will use the default values set in the ERX record.
    - dextrose 5 % and lactated Ringer’s bolus [400297]
- Antiarrhythmic
    - amiodarone IVPB bolus [420230]
    - amiodarone (Nexterone) infusion [420200]
    - amiodarone IVPB bolus with 24-hour infusion
        - Hint: This is another panel. You’ll need to search by name.

1. In the Pressors subsection, add a new item and search for “dopa”. Do not select anything yet.

- You have a few options here, including the DOPamine infusion.

1. Click on the Database tab and notice many dopamine infusion ERX records, but do not select any.

- These ERXs are examples of dispensables. In RX100, you saw that Epic uses IMS for IVs to prevent ordering providers from having to choose between many ERX records for similar products. Instead, they are given one option, an orderable. The DOPamine infusion on the Preference List tab is an orderable, and it is what you should choose to add to a preference list. When a provider orders the orderable, Epic will choose the appropriate dispensable automatically.

1. Go back to the Preference List tab, and select the DOPamine infusion.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|When you are unsure of which ERX record to add to a preference list, choose one that is on the Preference List tab. That usually ensures that the ERX is configured and it is an orderable instead of a dispensable.|

1. Notice that the name of the record you just chose includes “ORDERABLE.” That’s a good sign that you’ve chosen an orderable instead of a dispensable! Change the display name to “DOPamine infusion – standard strength”.
2. In the order composer, scroll down and select the **1,600 mcg/mL** concentration button and click **Accept**.

- Hint: The Concentration field is under the Admin Instructions.

1. You want the DOPamine infusion to appear in this subsection twice, once with a “standard” concentration and once with a “double” concentration.

- Add DOPamine infusion [420025] _again_.
- Change the display name to indicate double strength.
- Change the concentration to **3,200** **mcg/mL**.

1. Once you’re done, close the preference list.

#### Part 2: Attach Your Preference List

Now that your ICU meds preference list exists, you need to attach it to a profile for your TRN3## Critical Care department. You’ll be making these connections:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637269483486480977.png&ver=1591387548643)  
In Text: **Clinical Administration >> Management Options >> Profiles (LPR).**

1. At the **Profile** prompt search for your TRN3## Critical Care Profile.
2. From the profile menu, choose **Medication, Allergy, Imm, etc.** Then choose **Preference List, Order Search**.
3. Page down twice to the Inpatient Orders Preference Lists screen. Enter the following:

|**Type**|**List**|**Title**|
|---|---|---|
|Medications|TRN3## ICU MEDS|trn3## Meds|

Our preference list has a type of **Orders** and subtype of **Order Panels.** However, the panels all contain medications, so it's logical they appear under **Medications** on the Browse tab in Hyperspace. The Type in the profile doesn't _have_ to match up with the type/subtype in the preference list composer, though often it will. 

1. Press **SHIFT+F7.** Then type “opt” and press **ENTER** to return to the main Clinical Administration menu.

- You’ve linked your profile to your preference list, but your physician’s Department (DEP) record still needs to be attached to that profile.
- In the real world, this would almost certainly have already been done. We're having you do it so that you can see where a profile gets linked to a department. 

1. To do that, go to **Clinical Administration >> Facility Structure >> Departments/Units (DEP)**.
2. At the **Department** prompt, open your “TRN3## Critical Care.”
3. Page down twice to the EpicCare Department Information screen. Confirm that in the **Default Profile for Workstations in Department** field, your “TRN3## Critical Care” is listed.

- Even though the field says “for _Workstations_ in Department,” the profile will apply to any user who chooses this department as their _login_ department.

1. Press **SHIFT+F7** to close your record. Enter “opt” to return to the main Clinical Administration menu.

#### Part 3: Test Your Work

1. Log into Hyperspace as your PHYSICIAN. Your default department should be your **TRN3## Critical Care department**. If not, make sure to select and accept your TRN3## Critical Care department.

1. Open Wayne’s chart from Patient Lists.
2. Place a new order for “dopamine”.

- You should see at least two matches in the Medications section, one for standard strength and one for double strength.
- If you don't see the two matches, double check to make sure you logged in to your TRN### Critical Care department! If it's still not working, go back to Part 2 and make sure you completed all required steps.

1. Click the **Browse** tab.

- On the tree on the left side, do you see your “trn3## Meds” section?

1. Expand the trn3## Meds section and the subsections within.

- Do you see the sections and subsections you created earlier?
- Now, compare what your screen looks like now to what it looked like before:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637269485678405642.png&ver=1591387767853)

- Which list(s) have been replaced? Any idea why that happened?
- Notice that Labs, Imaging, Cardiology, and the other preference lists are still appearing, even though you didn't add those to your department profile. Each _type_ of preference list compiles separately. Since those lists didn't exist on the department profile, the system kept searching and eventually used the remaining lists specified in the System Definitions profile.

1. If you have time, go on to the next exercise.

#### If You Have Time: Editing Your Preference List

Log in to Classic as your administrator, go to the **Preference List Composer (LPF)** activity and open your TRN3## ICU MEDS record.

See if you can make the following changes to your preference list:

- Under Drips, rename the Pressors subsection to be “Pressors/Cardiotonics” and add this medication:
    - milrinone (Primacor) infusion
- Add a new section for Analgesics. Add the following meds directly to that section (no subsection):
    - morphine injection orderable [420065], 2 mg, IV, q4h PRN for moderate pain
        - Change the display name to indicate moderate pain
    - morphine injection orderable [420065], 4 mg, IV, q4h PRN for severe pain
        - Change the display name to indicate severe pain
    - fentanyl (Sublimaze) infusion [400020]
- Move the Analgesics section to the very top of the preference list tree. (Hint: Find the arrows to move sections in the bottom left corner).
- Add a subsection under Analgesics for “Non-Narcotic”. Add these medications to that subsection:
    - Acetaminophen liquid orderable (it will appear as acetaminophen (Tylenol) 160 mg/5mL oral liquid) 500 mg, oral, q6h PRN for mild pain
    - naproxen (Naprosyn) suspension 125 mg/5 mL, 500 mg, oral, q12h
- Add another subsection under Analgesics for “Narcotic”. Drag the two morphine injections and the fentanyl infusion from the Analgesics section to the Narcotic subsection.

After making these changes, close your preference list and test them out as your physician (remember to log in to your TRN### Critical Care department) in Wayne’s chart. It should look something like this:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638470429566023915.png&ver=1711482156603)

### Key Takeaways: Creating a Preference List

Preference lists are created/edited in the **Preference List Composer** activity.

Inpatient medication preference lists have the following properties if they do not contain panels:

- List type: Meds
- Sub type: Medications
- Ordering Mode: Inpatient

If they do contain panels, use these properties:

- List type: Orders
- Sub type: Order Panels
- Ordering Mode: Inpatient

How it Works:

- **List type** controls what kinds of records can be added to the preference list:
    - Lists with a Meds type only contain ERXs.
    - Lists with an Orders type can contain ERXs, EAPs, and panels.
    - Lists with a Procedure type only contain EAPs.
- Medications can be added to a preference list multiple times with different values. When defaults are set in the preference list, they override those set at the ERX level.
- Most often you will add preference lists to the profile attached to a user’s login department, but this may vary depending on the audience.
- You assign preference lists in Text:
    - **Path: Management Options >> Profiles (LPR) >>** Open the Profile **>> Medication, Allergy, Imm, etc. >> Preference List, Order Search**
    - Page down to the **Inpatient Orders Preference Lists** screen.

  
When adding preference lists, you have the following fields:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Type|Organizes preference lists in the Browse tab. You can only list each Type once.<br><br>Types come from a category list: LPF 130 (editable).|
|List|For each type, enter a Preference List (LPF) record.|
|Title|Controls how the preference list is labeled on the Browse tab. If left blank, the system will display the Type.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|When you assign preference lists of a certain type to a profile, you only override preference lists _of that type_ from other levels of the profile hierarchy. Only override the preference lists that are necessary for a given user.|

### Beyond the Basics: Limiting Choices when Making Preference Lists

When you add items to a Preference List (LPF) record, the system initially limits your choices to _another_ set of preference lists specifically for creating Preference Lists (or Order Sets), not the same as when entering orders.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637269497688111142.png&ver=1591388968823)

Without this second layer of preference list, you’d have to build Preference Lists by searching against the Database tab. That means you could potentially add non-configured, non-formulary ERX records to a Preference List (LPF) record used by physicians or nurses.

A profile (typically Location or System Definitions level) determines the available Preference Lists.

**Path: Profile >> Medication, Allergy, Immunization, etc. >> Preference List, Order Search >> page down x4**

### Reviewing the Chapter

Review Questions

1. Which of these appear to a user on the Browse tab? (Choose ALL that apply).  
    a) The user’s personal preference list  
    b) The user’s profile preference lists  
    c) The facility preference list

A and B.

1. When you configure sections and subsections in a preference list, where do those appear to an end user? (Choose ONE only).  
    a) On the Browse tab  
    b) On Preference List search results, under the Pref List column  
    c) In the Orders activity, after the orders have been signed  
    d) None of the above—end users can’t see the sections or subsections

A, on the Browse tab. The sections and subsections help organize the tree.

1. Deb Gurney is an ED nurse who logs in to the EMH EMERGENCY department. Her EpicCare Security Class (“ED NURSE”) is linked to a profile that has two preference lists: ED Meds and ED Procedures. The EMH EMERGENCY department’s profile is linked to one preference list: ED Consults. The system default profile has seven preference lists, including ones for medications, procedures, and consults. Which of these preference lists are part of Deb Gurney’s Preference List tab? (Choose ALL that apply).  
    a) ED Consults  
    b) ED Meds  
    c) ED Procedures  
    d) Four of the preference lists in the system default profile  
    e) All seven of the preference lists in the system default profile

A, B, C, and D. The system compiles each type of preference list separately. Deb's security-level profile contributes the ED Meds and ED Procedures preference lists. Her department profile contributes the ED consults list. The rest come from the System Definitions profile.

## 10. Configuring the Facility List

### Introduction

When clinicians enter orders, they select medications from the Preference List and Facility List tabs. In the previous chapter you learned about how the Preference List tab is populated. In this lesson, you will learn about the Facility List tab.

The Facility List contains all of the medications available in the hospital. If clinicians don’t find a medication on the Facility List, pharmacy staff will initiate a procurement process. Without a Facility List, we wouldn’t know if the medication is available or not.

In this lesson, you will learn to build the Facility List for your hospital.

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able to…

- Create a new Facility List Preference List (LPF)
- Link the facility list to the Central Pharmacy Med List (EFY)
- Attach the facility list to the Hospital (EAF)

### What is the Facility List?

The Facility List is a Preference List (LPF) that populates the **Facility List** tab for all clinicians at a specific hospital.

The Facility List is the largest search available to doctors and nurses. It is specific to the hospital of the patient you are placing orders for. The list includes:

- All medications on the hospital’s Central Pharmacy Med List that users are allowed to order directly
- All non-medication orders and panels available in the patient’s hospital
- The non-formulary request

### Adding Medications to the Facility List

Many of the steps in this chapter are similar to building preference lists for other users. However, since the facility list contains all of the available medications, you build it from the central pharmacy med list. This saves you time.

Summary of the build steps:

1. Create a Preference List (LPF)
2. Configure the Central Pharmacy Med List (EFY)
3. Link the Medication List and Preference List
4. Attach the Preference List to the Hospital (EAF)

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637286926635925487.png&ver=1593131863463)

#### Step 1: Creating a Preference List

To start, you create an empty medication preference list:

- List Type: Meds
- Subtype: Medications
- Ordering mode: Inpatient

**Path:** In **Classic,** Click the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner (ctrl + space bar) and search for **“Preference List Composer”**

Create a new medication preference list called “trn3## Facility Medications”.

After it is created, close the record.

#### Step 2: Identifying the Orderable Medications

The Central Pharmacy medication list represents all _available_ medications in the hospital but not everything you stock should be _orderable_.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|Your central pharmacy med list includes Sterile Water for Injection IV Soln, which you use to make mixtures. You’d never order it on its own, so it shouldn’t be on the facility list.|

On your medication list, remove the green dot to remove a medication from the associated preference list.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637474280390113341.png&ver=1611874439070)

Open your trn3## Central Pharmacy Med List and indicate that STERILE WATER FOR INJECTION IV SOLN should never be ordered by itself. (HINT: Remember to click **Edit**.)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|The green dot is importable. The import spreadsheet includes a column to indicate which medications appear on your pharmacy preference list.|

#### Step 3: Linking the Med List and Preference List

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637263439113138199.png&ver=1590783111400&ver=1590783111400)

Link your central pharmacy medication list to “trn3## Facility Medications". Close your Central Pharmacy Med List.

After the two are linked, the preference list populates with all medications that have a green dot. When the medication list updates, the preference list updates.

#### Step 4: Attaching the Preference List to a Hospital

This preference list is attached to the hospital.

**Path: Clinical Administration >> Facility Structure >> Locations (EAF) >> “trn3## Hospital” >> Home + F9 search “Inpatient Facility Preference List”**  
(if you can't get Home + F9 to work, page down ~70 times)

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637589137869318621.png&ver=1623352986933)

Attach your “trn3## Facility Medications” to your “trn3## Hospital.”

- Hint: Make sure you are working in the inpatient section!

In Hyperspace, log in as your pharmacist (RX##/train) and open Kristi’s chart to the Orders activity.

In Kristi’s chart, click **+New** and find trn3## gentamicin on the Facility List tab.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|When you need to add new medications to the Facility List, add them to the Central Pharmacy Med List with a green dot. If you manually edit a preference list that is linked to a medication list, those changes will be overwritten the next time the preference list is rebuilt from the med list.|

### Key Takeaways

The Facility List is the largest search available to doctors and nurses. It also helps pharmacy staff to determine what is in stock. It is specific to the hospital of the patient you are placing orders for. The list includes:

- All medications on the hospital’s Central Pharmacy Med List, including the non-formulary request
- All non-medication orders and panels available in the patient’s hospital

Willow Analysts are responsible for the meds and med panels on the Facility list.

|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|The preference list that pharmacists and other users see on their Preference List tab is often created by duplicating the Facility Medications preference list at the largest hospital for an organization.|

### Reviewing the Chapter

Review Questions

1. Should the facility list be built manually, or should it be linked to a Medication List (EFY) record? If it’s linked to a Medication List, which list should it be linked to?

It should be linked to your central pharmacy’s medication list. This preference list should contain all medications available in the hospital, not just the subset of orders commonly used by a department or specialty.

1. Which medications are copied from a medication list to its linked preference list?

The medications with a green dot next to them on the medication list are copied to the linked preference list.

1. Why should some medications be on the central pharmacy medication list but NOT on the facility list?

A medication that is stocked but never ordered by itself (for example, sterile water) should NOT be copied to the linked preference list.

1. You create a facility list for your hospital. You link it to the central pharmacy medication list. But when you test it out, the medications are not showing on the Facility List tab. What could be wrong? (Choose only ONE.)
    1. You didn’t attach the preference list to the hospital.
    2. You forgot to close the med list record before testing.
    3. You opened the chart of a patient in the wrong hospital.
    4. All of the above.

Answer: D. All of the above.

Study Checklist

Make sure you can define the following key terms:

Facility List preference list

Linked preference list

Make sure you can perform the following tasks:

Build a facility list by attaching it to the central pharmacy medication list

Maintain a facility list via the central pharmacy medication list

Attach the preference lists to the hospital

Make sure you fully understand and can explain the following concepts:

The purpose of the green dots on a medication list

Why you should generate the facility list from the central pharmacy medication list rather than building it manually

## 11. Configuring the Formulary

### Introduction

As you learned in RX100, the _formulary_ for a hospital is the list of all medications approved for use by the hospital’s Pharmaceuticals & Therapeutics (P&T) committee.

The formulary is a Medication List (EFY) record, much like the ones you attach to Pharmacy (PHR) records. The key differences are:

- The formulary is the list of _approved_ medications for your hospital, not the _available_ medications.
- The formulary is attached directly to your hospital’s Location (EAF) record, not a Pharmacy (PHR) record.

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able to…

- Explain the impact of the formulary med list
- Create and edit the formulary for a hospital
- Explain the similarities and differences between the Central Pharmacy Med List, the Facility List, and the formulary

### The Formulary and the Central Pharmacy Med List

#### What Does the Formulary Do?

The system uses the formulary medication list to flag orders that aren’t approved for use at the hospital. If an ordered medication is _not_ on the formulary, then the order is flagged as Non-formulary in Verify Orders:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637638431210448285.png&ver=1628282321033)

Also, during medication reconciliation, the system can suggest an alternative when a user attempts to order a home med that is not on the formulary. 

#### Formulary vs. Central Pharmacy’s Med List

Central Pharmacy and Formulary medication lists have similar products. However, the lists serve different purposes:

|Central Pharmacy Med List|Formulary Med List|
|---|---|
|- _Available_ medications (ERXs and NDCs stocked in the hospital)<br>- Determines which package dispenses. Orders _cannot_ be verified without a package<br>- Unique to each hospital|- Medications _approved for use_ by P&T committee<br>- Flags orders for medications not on this list. Non-formulary orders _can_ be verified<br>- Can be shared by multiple hospitals|

Most hospitals have a "non-formulary shelf," a place where they keep medications that aren't technically approved for use. A pharmacy might have non-formulary medications in stock because:

- The buyer purchased some to fulfill a valid non-formulary request, and there's some left over.
- They might want to have a small amount of commonly used alternatives to the formulary meds in stock, to treat patients who are non-responsive to or cannot tolerate a formulary med.  

Likewise, hospitals don't always keep every formulary medication in stock. An approved medication might not be stocked because:

- There is a shortage of the medication, and it's on backorder.
- It's very expensive, and the buyer purchases it as needed.
- The formulary might be shared by multiple hospitals, but this hospital might not use a given medication frequently enough to stock it. 

#### In-Class Exercises

|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=U:\Production\Online%20Publisher\Images\train_critical.png&ver=1590174660317)|The following exercises assume that you have done all the steps and In-Class Exercises from these lessons:<br><br>- Chapter 2: Building Pharmacies<br>- Chapter 3: Managing Medication Lists<br><br>If you have not done these steps, this exercise may not work as written.|

##### Exercise 1: Creating Your Hospital Formulary

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|Your P&T committee has given you a list of medications that are approved for use at your TRN3## Hospital. The list is very similar to the Central Pharmacy med list, except the medication entacapone is available but NOT approved for use, and the 8 mg/mL strength of furosemide oral solution is approved for use but NOT available.|

Part 1: Duplicate Your Central Pharmacy Med List

1. In Text, page up all the way until you get to the Training Application Access menu. Then go to **Chronicles** (instead of Clinical Administration). 
2. At the **Database** prompt, enter “EFY” (the INI for Medication Lists).
3. Press any key to move past the title screen.
4. Go to **Enter Data >> Duplicate Formulary**.
5. Enter "TRN3## Central Pharmacy Med List".
6. Enter " * " at the New FORMULARY ID(.1) prompt.

- This causes the system to automatically assign an ID to your new record. 

1. Enter "yes" to Indicate that you DO want to give your duplicate record a new name.
2. Enter “TRN3## Formulary” as the new name.
3. Enter "yes" to complete the duplication.
4. Enter “opt” to return to the Chronicles Main Menu. There, enter “q” to Quit chronicles.

Part 2: Link your Formulary to Your Hospital

1. In Classic, open your TRN3## Hospital.
    - **Rx Admin >> Hospital/Clinic Admin**
2. In the **Hospital/Clinic formulary** field, enter your TRN3## Formulary.
3. Accept your changes and close the Hospital record.

Part 3: Test your Formulary

1. Log in to Hyperspace as your Pharmacist user (rx##) and open Kristi's chart to the Orders activity.
2. Enter the following orders for your Kristi patient:
    - ENTACAPONE 200 MG PO TABS [26547]
    - FUROSEMIDE 8 MG/ML PO SOLN [3293]
        - Select a dose of 40 mg
3. Click **Sign & Verify**. Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider.
4. In Verify Orders, confirm that the entacapone order does NOT have a "Non-formulary" flag, and the furosemide DOES have a "Non-formulary" flag.
5. Review both order’s dispensing information.
    - Does the entacapone have a package to dispense? Why is the furosemide missing a package?

Yes. The package is chosen from the Central Pharmacy Med List (EFY), and because the furosemide is not available it is not on that list.

1. Reject both orders. Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider.
2. In Classic, open your "TRN3## Formulary" to make the proper adjustments.
    - **Rx Admin >> Medication List Admin**
3. Click **Edit**, then select the ENTACAPONE 200 MG PO TABS [26547] and click **Remove** (don't just clear the green dot!):
4. Click **Add**, and search for  the FUROSEMIDE 8 MG/ML PO SOLN [3293]
    - Does it matter if you select an NDC? Why or why not?

No. The formulary only serves to indicate what's approved; providers will not be ordering anything from the formulary so NDCs do not matter.

1. Click **Close** to save your changes to the med list.
2. Back in Kristi's chart in Hyperspace, enter and click **Sign & Verify** for the entacapone and furosemide orders again. Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider.
3. In verify orders, confirm the entacapone is flagged as non-formulary, and the furosemide does NOT have the non-formulary flag.
    - What triggered this flag?

Meds that are NOT on the Formulary med list will have a non-formulary flag.

1. Review the dispensing information for entacapone.
    - Is there a package listed? Yes   

1. Verify the order for entacapone.
    - If something is non-formulary, can you still verify it? What would prevent you from verifying it?

Yes; if a package were NOT selected, you could not verify the order.

1. ​​Try to verify the order for furosemide. Can you?   No  ​​​​​​​
    - Just because something is on the formulary, doesn't mean it can always be verified.

##### If You Have Time: Configuring the Non-Formulary Request

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|The non-formulary request is a placeholder ERX a provider uses when they want to order a medication that is not approved. It should be orderable for all providers, but should also prompt the proper warnings during verification.|

The non-formulary request should appear on the Facility List, but it should be flagged as non-formulary in Verify Orders.

1. Log into Hyperspace as your pharmacist user (rx##) and open Kristi's chart to the Orders activity.
2. Click **+New** and search for "non-formulary" **on the Facility List.**
3. How was the non-formulary request added to the Facility List?
    - **Hint:** Look in the "Pref List" column

The non-formulary request is coming from your TRN3## Facility Medications preference list.

1. Accept the Non-Formulary request from the Facility List and open its order composer.
2. Indicate that you would like to order Azithromycin, 250 mg intravenously every 24 hours.
3. Fill out the rest of the non-formulary request with the following:
    - **Drug Name:** Azithromycin
    - **Form:** solution
    - **Length of Therapy:** 3 days
    - **How soon needed?:** 0-24 hrs
    - **Reason for Non-Formulary**: No IV solution on Formulary.
4. Accept your order composer and click **Sign & Verify**. Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider.
5. In Verify Orders, does the non-formulary request appear with a Non-formulary flag?    No   
6. Reject the order.
7. Remove the non-formulary request from your TRN3## Formulary.
8. Place a new order for a non-formulary request of Azithromycin, 250 mg intravenously every 24 hours.
9. Fill out the rest of the non-formulary request with the following:
    - **Drug Name:** Azithromycin
    - **Form:** solution
    - **Length of Therapy:** 3 days
    - **How soon needed?:** 0-24 hrs
    - **Reason for Non-Formulary**: No IV solution on Formulary.
10. Accept your order composer and click **Sign & Verify**
11. Select Telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider.
12. In Verify Orders, confirm that there is a Non-formulary flag on the current non-formulary request.

### Key Takeaways

The Formulary is a Medication List (EFY) that represents all approved medications at your hospital.

- Flags non-formulary orders
- Does not prevent users from verifying orders

You can create the formulary by duplicating your central pharmacy medication list in Text or using an import spreadsheet.

You link the Formulary to your Hospital record in Classic:

- **Rx Admin >> Hospital/Clinic Admin >> General form**

The non-formulary request should be added to the Central Pharmacy Medication List, but not to the Formulary.

### Beyond the Basics: Dynamic Alternatives for Non-Formulary Medications

At most hospitals, physicians sign on to by-laws that limit their medication orders to the formulary except in special circumstances. However, physicians often don’t know exactly what is on the formulary. So, when a patient arrives in the hospital, guidance on what is formulary can be helpful.

A Dynamic Alternative is a single Alternative (LMA) record that appears when a physician orders a non-formulary prior-to-admission medication. The alternative automatically generates suggestions based on the following:

- If there are other products (ERX records) on formulary that represent the same generic medication as what’s being reordered, the system will suggest those instead

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638457654025957026.png&ver=1710204602590)

- If there aren’t any products of the same generic medication, the system will suggest other formulary medications from the same pharmaceutical subclass

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638457654219242965.png&ver=1710204621917)

As your pharmacist, in your Kristi patient’s chart, go to the **Admission** tab. Click **Admission Orders**.

In the **Review Home Medications** section, add these to the patient’s list of prior-to-admission medications, and indicate both medications were last taken **yesterday**:

- amoxicillin (Amoxil) suspension 125 mg/5 mL, 125 mg dose, q8h SCH frequency
- entacapone (Comtan) tablet 200 mg

On the **Reconcile Orders** tab, order the amoxicillin. You won’t get any warnings.

- **Hint**: Click the "+" icon

In Classic, open your TRN3## FORMULARY. Remove the AMOXICILLIN 125 MG/5 ML PO SUSR (not just the green dot; fully remove it) and close the list.

In Hyperspace, back on the **Reconcile Orders** tab, clear the "+" button and select it again. You should see the first screenshot above. Accept one of the “suspension” alternatives.

- If the Alternative does not appear, close and re-open Kristi’s chart

Try to order the entacapone (Comtan) tablet. You should see the second screenshot shown above. Select the recommended tolcapone. Notice that the dose and frequency are blank. Why do you think that is?

When a user selects a dynamic alternative, the system assesses whether the default dose, route, and frequency of the original order are legitimate choices for the replacement medication. If there is any doubt, the field will be blank the ordering user must then manually enter a value. This prevents physicians from assuming that the recommended alternative is configured to be equivalent of the order it is replacing.

You can configure medication-specific Alternatives that suggest alternative medications with the specific doses, routes, and frequencies. But that must be done on a medication-by-medication basis.

The list of possible exception codes is a configurable category list, ORD 7086.

This configuration can be disabled for individual departments and hospitals.

### Big Picture: The Three Big Lists

Throughout class, we’ve discussed three “big lists:” The central pharmacy’s med list, the formulary, and the facility list. Use this table to help synthesize your understanding.

## 12. Configuring Charging

### Introduction

As you learned in RX100, Willow can trigger charges for medications either when they are dispensed or when they are documented as administered. When a medication charge is triggered, Willow will attempt to calculate the dollar amount of the charge and send that information to the billing system. The billing system (Resolute Hospital Billing or a non-Epic system) is responsible for generating bills, filing claims, and tracking reimbursement.

If Willow is not configured correctly, it will fail to generate these charges. Charging errors will be sent to an In Basket pool that the project team can see from their Dashboard.

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able to…

- Describe what must be configured in order for a charge to trigger
- Configure the system to charge on dispense or administration
- Find more information about charging for medications

### Calculating a Charge

How much a patient is charged is driven by two components:

- The cost of the medication, and…
- The percent and/or flat fee markup/discount

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|You purchased the 5 mL bottle of gentamicin for $0.63 per mL. For all bulk medications, you add an additional $31.50 flat fee . If a bulk package costs $50 or over, you also add a 10% markup.|

#### Assigning Cost

Cost can be assigned to an order in three places; the system will use the first cost it can find, searching in this order of specificity:

- NDC: package record, representing a specific ERX, package size/type, and manufacturer
- NDC Grouper: a record to group packages of the same ERX and package size/type, regardless of manufacturer
- ERX: medication record (and all packages of that medication)

Because NDC costs for a single ERX vary, costs are typically assigned at the NDC level. To assign a cost to an NDC:

1. Open the NDC record and go to the **Cost Info** form.

- **Path: Rx Admin >> NDC Admin >> Cost Info**

1. Enter the **Cost to use for Billing**.
2. Optional: On the **Overrides** form you can set different costs based on Hospital.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|You have been ordering and dispensing NDC 17478-283-10 (5 mL bottle of gentamicin) all day, but no charges have dropped.<br><br>A number of error messages have been sent to your In Basket.|

In Hyperspace, in Kristi’s chart, discontinue any active orders and place a new order for your trn3## gentamicin.

Click **Sign & Verify.** Select telephone with readback and select Kristi's attending provider, and then click **Show Charge**.

- An error! Review the error message.

**TRAINER DEMO**: Watch as your instructor sets the cost for NDC 17478-283-10 to $0.630 per mL.

- If you are currently taking class, do NOT make this setting; it will affect the whole class. The trainer will make this setting for everyone. 

In Hyperspace, click **Show Charge** again. 

- The original error message is gone. Now there is a different one!

#### Adding a Markup and Fee

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|For bulk medications dispensed at your TRN3## Hospital, you add an additional $31.50 flat fee . If a bulk package costs $50 or over, you also add a 10% markup.|

Once the cost is set, we use **Charge Tables (CHG)** to add a markup or discount percentage and/or flat fee to the cost. Charge tables represent the equations you use to calculate charges.

Charge tables are most often based on medication type (i.e., a charge table that represents the equation for standard unit dose medications). For multi-hospital organizations, you may have charge tables to represent the equation for a particular medication type at one particular hospital.

**Path: Classic >> Rx Admin >> Charge Table Admin**

**TRAINER DEMO**: In Classic, your Trainer will open the MULTIDOSE BULK charge table.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|_Configuring Charge Tables_ <br><br>You are not expected to know how to configure a charge table for your assessments. For more information review the “[Medication Charge Tables, Charge Methods, and Charge Maps](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=3446316&PrefDocID=98980)” section of the _Medication Charging Setup and Support Guide_ on Galaxy.|

#### Assigning Charge Tables

Charge tables are assigned to medications based on charge methods and charge maps:

**Charge methods** are labels, typically based on the type of medication.

- Stored in the category list CHM 110
- Most commonly set at the NDG or ERX level

**Charge maps** link charge methods to charge tables.

- Most commonly set in system definitions
- Can include mapping for a specific Hospital or Department

##### Charge Map

To view, build, and edit charge maps in Classic, go to **RX Admin >> Charge Mapping Admin.**

**TRAINER DEMO**: Watch as your Trainer opens the charge map named CHARGE MAP.

- Which charge method is the MULTIDOSE BULK charge table mapped to?

The MULTIDOSE BULK charge table is mapped to the Multidose Bulk charge method.

Leaving the charge map’s **Default charge method** field blank ensures that non-configured medications will fail to calculate a charge.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|_Put Specific Cases Above General Cases_<br><br>The system reads a charge map from top to bottom and uses the first row that matches. Put hospital-specific or department-specific rows first before more general rows.|

Epic recommends building one charge map and attaching it to Pharmacy System Definitions (RXD).

- **Path: Rx Admin >> System Definitions >> Charging >> Default charge mapping**

The charge map will map ALL charge methods to an appropriate charge table. Charges calculate without end-user intervention.

##### Assigning Charge Method in an ERX

If all available packages of an ERX should use the same charge table, then it is most efficient to set the charge method at the ERX level.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|All of the NDCs associated with your TRN3## gentamicin are multidose bulk bottles and the charge should be calculated using the MULTIDOSE BULK charge table.|

Assign Charge Methods to ERX records in Text:

1. **Text >> Clinical Administration >> Meds, Allergies, Imm., etc. >> Medications (ERX)**. 
2. Open the ERX record. Page down 11 times to the Facility Administered Packaging and Billing Settings screen.
3. Enter a **Default charge method**.

Configure your TRN3## GENTAMICIN to have a charge method of “Multidose Bulk”. Close the record when done.

Back in Hyperspace, in Verify Orders, refresh Dispense Details and click **Show Charge**. Did a charge calculate? 

Yes!

Overview of how Epic calculates a charge.

##### Assigning Charge Method in an NDC Group (NDG)

For some medications, like injections and oral liquids, you may need to use different charge methods for different NDCs.

Like costs, charge methods may be assigned at multiple levels. When a setting is made in more than one record, Epic always selects the value at the most specific level. (Most specific to least specific):

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637263517885360098.png&ver=1590790988620)

An **NDC Group (NDG**) is a grouping of NDCs for an ERX with similar properties, such as package size and package description.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|For furosemide 10mg/ml oral solution you carry a 60 mL bottle, 4 mL cup, 2 mL prepacked syringe and 1 mL prepacked syringe. The specific NDC you stock for each package size changes over time.<br><br>You want to use the Unit Dose Standard method table for the 1 mL, 2 mL and 4 mL packages. For the 60 mL bottle that techs draw custom doses from, you want to use the Multidose Standard charge method.|

In this scenario, the most efficient way to set up charging is to create an NDC Grouper (NDG) for all 60 mL packages of furosemide 10 mg/mL PO soln, and assign the Multidose Standard charge method there. Then assign the ERX record a charge method of Unit Dose Standard. 

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638115310310608763.png&ver=1675977431070)

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638115308916441798.png&ver=1675977291643)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|Both the **Cost to use for billing** and **Charge method** can be set in the NDC, NDC Grouper, or ERX. Epic will use the setting it finds first, searching in that order. Epic searches separately for Cost to use for billing and Charge method values. It is possible for the Cost to use for billing to come from one type of record and the Charge method to come from another type of record for a given medication order.|

### Triggering Charges

Verify Kristi’s order and view it in Order Hx. Did a charge occur?

Select the Dispense action and review the Charge Status in the report below.

- What’s the error? Procedure ID missing from order

Epic is calculating a charge (as you saw in Verify Orders) but you’re still receiving an error because the charge wasn’t sent to billing. You need one more setting: a linked procedure.

#### The Linked Procedure

All charges are based on records in the Procedure (EAP) master file. These records include:

- All HCPCS charge codes for professional billing
    - Also referred to as Bill codes or J codes
    - HCPCS stands for Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System
- Every CDM (Charge Description Master) code for hospital billing.

Unlike many systems, you don’t need a separate CDM code for each medication. Instead, most organizations have 6-12 “Linked Procedures” for medication charges. These linked procedures are used to:

- Determine the Revenue Code.

- Revenue codes group charges on claims generated from hospital billing. Each linked procedure has a default revenue code (e.g., 250), but can have override revenue codes based on the payer and/or the patient’s class (inpatient, ED, observation, etc.).

- Determine how Epic picks a cost center.

- Most medication charges are assigned to a cost center based on the dispensing location (PHR). Some hospitals assign charges for certain things like IV fluids or petroleum jelly to a “Central Supply” cost center. That requires a different Linked Procedure.

Which linked procedure to use and where it’s attached depends on your billing system.

##### If You Are Using Resolute Hospital Billing…

You validate (or add) the linked procedure for every ERX you dispense. The linked procedure depends on what type of medication it is.

|**If the ERX is a/an…**|**Then use…**|
|---|---|
|Contrast|HC RX 255 CONTRASTS [2550000001]|
|IV fluids (e.g., D5NS, lactated Ringers)|HC RX 258 IV SOLUTIONS [2580000001]|
|Epoetin < 10,000 units|HC RX 634 EPOETIN <10,000 UNITS [6340000001]|
|Epoetin > 10,000 units|HC RX 635 EPOETIN >10,000 UNITS [6350000001]|

For medications not covered above, follow these considerations:

|**If the ERX…**|**Then use…**|
|---|---|
|Has a HCPCS code|HC RX 250 GENERAL PHARMACY W/ HCPCS (ALT 636 FOR OP/ED) [2500000004]|
|Does not have a HCPCS code and is self-administrable|HC RX 637 SELF ADMINISTRABLE DRUGS (ALT 250 FOR MEDICARE IP) [6370000001]|
|Does not have a HCPCS code and is not self-administrable|HC RX 250 GENERAL PHARMACY W/O HCPCS [2500000005]|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|_What medications are considered “self-administrable”?_<br><br>This term comes from CMS and isn’t well defined. In the Foundation System, the following types of medications are considered “self-administrable:”<br><br>- Oral medications, such as tablets, capsules, and oral solutions<br>- Inhalants, such as inhalers and nasal sprays<br>- Otic and Ophthalmic solutions (eye and ear drops)<br>- Topical creams and ointments<br><br>Medications that are _not_ considered self-administered are commonly IV medications.<br><br>If you are unsure of whether a medication ought to be considered “self-administrable” or not, contact your hospital billing team and ask them for the appropriate rev code, or ask your Epic representative.|

Open your gentamicin record in Text. On the first screen, find the **Linked Procedure** field.

Add a Linked Procedure of HC RX 637 SELF ADMINISTRABLE DRUGS to your gentamicin record then close the record.

- Gentamicin does NOT have a HCPCS code and is self-administrable.

As your admin in Classic, open Order Hx for your Kristi patient's gentamicin order, and resubmit your charge.

- You should see a green "+" next to the Dispense (First Dose) action. Yippee! 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|_What’s with the “ALT” in some of the linked procedure names?_<br><br>Some revenue codes are only allowed for certain patient classes. For example, for medications with HCPCS, the rev code for inpatient is 250, but the alternate rev code for outpatient is 636. Because the default is set in the ERX, there isn’t a way to make the patient class differentiation at that level. The name reflects both rev codes, and Resolute Hospital Billing can select the correct one based on department or patient class.|

##### If You Are Using a Third-Party Billing System…

Every medication order needs a Linked Procedure. The difference is where you attach it. Assuming that your third-party does not require revenue codes from Epic, simply assign a “global” Linked Procedure in Pharmacy System Definitions:

1. Open Pharmacy System Definitions: **Rx Admin >> Pharmacy System Definitions**
2. On the **Charging** form, enter a **Default procedure link**.

#### What Information Is Included with a Charge?

Willow sends all charges to the Charge Router. The Charge Router checks for errors and routes it to the appropriate billing system: Resolute Professional Billing, Resolute Hospital Billing, or a non-Epic billing system. The billing system uses charge information to generate claims.

Different information is required on a claim based on the payer, the medication, whether the patient was in the Emergency Department, etc. That information is determined by Resolute Billing.

Willow sends the Charge Router all information that may be needed for any given claim, and lets the Charge Router and Resolute sort it out. You can see the information sent using the Charge Router Reconciliation report.

**Path:** In **Classic,** Click the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner (ctrl + space bar) and search for **"Charge Router Reconciliation Report"**

Among other things, the information includes:

- The Medication (ERX) record and Package (NDC) record
- How much the dose cost the hospital (the Representative **Cost** field)
- How much the hospital is charging the patient (the **Price** field)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|The dollar value charged to the patient (the **Price**) isn’t usually how much the hospital expects to be paid. Most payers have existing agreements with hospitals about how much they will pay for each medication, or for the overall hospitalization based on the patient’s procedures and/or diseases (via DRGs).<br><br>The “official” dollar amount of the charge is important, however, for two main reasons:<br><br>- Accounting: Hospitals can write off the difference between what they charge and what they get reimbursed.<br>- Allocation of funds: If a hospital gets reimbursed $1000 for an admission (based on a DRG), and pharmacy generated 50% of the total claim, then pharmacy will usually get “credit” for $500 of that actual revenue.|

#### Beyond the Basics: Assigning HCPCS Codes

In the United States, some payers require HCPCS codes (a.k.a. “J-codes”) for certain medications given in certain circumstances. CMS maintains a list of NDCs, their associated HCPCS codes, and “quantity” of drug represented by each code.

As of 2018, Epic’s Foundation System has HCPCS codes configured in all appropriate ERX records. However, you may need to change a few codes if your organization charges differently for some medication and you’ll need to continue to update HCPCS codes as they change.

You can configure HCPCS codes on the **Overrides** form of a Medication, NDC Group, or NDC record. As usual, the system uses the values from the most specific record.

#### Beyond the Basics: Calculating Charges for Mixtures

By default, the system calculates charges for each ingredient in a mixture and sends those charges to the charge router individually. You can override this behavior and charge a flat fee for mixtures.

### Troubleshooting a Charge

With so many records involved, it can be difficult to identify how a charge is calculated any given order. Use the Charge Trace Report to see how Epic calculated a charge:

- **Path: Order Hx >> Troubleshooting >> Charge Trace**

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637263524378993742.png&ver=1590791637993)

### Configuring when Charges Occur

Epic can generate charges on:

- Dispense
- Administration

You can enable/disable charge on administration at three places:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637263524731525013.png&ver=1590791673227)

If one or more do NOT allow charge on administration, the system charges on dispense.

#### Medication (NDC, NDG, ERX)

To disable charge on administration:

1. From the **Rx Admin** menu, open the record.
2. On the **Billing** form, enter “No” in the **Allow charge on administration if enabled in unit and pharmacy** field.

By default, all three types of records (NDC, NDG, and ERX) allow charging on administration.

Epic looks from the most specific to the least specific level to see if charge on administration is disabled. If it is disabled at any level, they system will charge on dispense—_unless_ it is specifically _enabled_ in a more specific level.

#### Dispense Location

To disable charge on administration:

1. Go to **Rx Admin** **>> Pharmacy Admin** and open the PHR record.
2. On the **General** form, uncheck **Enable Charging on Administration**.

This setting is most commonly used when there is an ADS cabinet in a procedural area (like Radiology), where medications are administered but NOT documented in Epic and patients are not transferred to the unit.

#### Patient’s Unit

To enable charge on administration:

1. Go to **Classic >>** **Rx Admin >> Unit/Department Admin** and open the unit.
2. On the **General** form, check **Enable charging at administration**.

In Classic, enable charge on administration on your trn3## 3 North unit.

Back in Hyperspace, place a new order for trn3## gentamicin for Kristi. Click **Include Now** so that you have a dose due immediately. Sign, verify, and administer the medication. Review the charge details in Order Hx.  
 

#### How Does Charging on Administration Work?

##### Crediting a Patient

There are two ways to credit a patient for an administered med.

- If the medication was charted as given on the MAR, but it wasn’t really administered, then the MAR needs to be edited to reflect that. Credits will automatically be generated if a Given action on the MAR is canceled or changed to a different action.
- If the wrong patient was given a medication, and therefore the medication must be charted as being given but the patient shouldn’t get charged, then you can select the Admin action and click the **Credit** button in the activity toolbar.

##### Patient-Supplied Medications and Bulk Products

A medication marked as **Patient Supplied for [x]** doses does not charge on administration until at least one dose is dispensed.

Multi-dose products generate a charge on the first administration. The system does not generate any more charges until it is dispensed again, after which the next administration generates a charge.

##### Charging for an Entire Package

Charges are calculated based on the amount dispensed (if charging on dispense) or on the amount administered (if charging on administration).

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|You are charging on admin and dispense a 4 mL cup of furosemide (Lasix) oral 10 mg/mL solution. A nurse administers 2 mL and wastes the rest. By default, Epic charges for 2 mL, and the waste is not charged.|

To charge for an entire package when charging on admin:

1. Open the NDC record and go to the **Cost Info** form.
2. In the **Charge in increments of:** field, enter the package size.

- Rounds admin amount up to this increment for charging.

**TRAINER DEMO**: Watch as your Trainer configures NDC 68094-756-62 to charge for the entire 4 mL package.

Back in Hyperspace, for Kristi, order **30 mg** of furosemide 10 mg/mL oral solution [3292], sign, verify, and administer a dose.

Go to Order Hx, and for the Admin action, go to **Troubleshooting >> Charge Trace**, and expand the “Using charge of…” section.

- Did this charge for the amount administered or for the full 4 mL package?

Yes! Full 4 mL package

### Key Takeaways

To calculate a charge, you need:

||**Typically assigned in…**|
|---|---|
|**Cost**|NDC|
|**Charge Method**<br><br>_(Medication Label)_|ERX or NDG|
|**Charge Map**<br><br>_(Assigns Charge Tables to Charge Methods)_|System Definitions (RXD)|
|**Charge Table**<br><br>_(Markup/Discount Equation)_|Charge Map|

To send the charge to billing, you need:

||**Typically assigned in…**|
|---|---|
|**Linked Procedure**<br><br>_(Routes charge)_|ERX|

If a Cost, Charge Method, Charge Map, or Linked Procedure is configured at multiple levels, Epic uses the value found in the most specific record. NDC records are more specific than NDG records, and NDGs are more specific than ERXs.

By default, Epic charges on dispense. To charge on administration:

- The NDC, NDG, and/or ERX must allow charge on admin (they all do by default). If they disagree, the setting in the most specific record applies.
- The dispensing Pharmacy (PHR) record must allow charging on admin (they do by default)
- The patient’s Unit (DEP) record must allow charging on admin (they do NOT by default)

If any of the three spots do _not_ allow charging on administration, Epic will charge on dispense.

### Reviewing the Lesson

Review Questions

1. Where can you enable or disable charging on administration?

The patient’s unit, the order’s dispense location (pharmacy), or the medication (NDC, NDC Group, or ERX) being dispensed.

1. You order a medication for a patient. The ERX record allows charge on admin, the dispense location allows charge on admin but the patient’s department does NOT allow charge on admin.  
    True or False: Charges for this order will trigger on dispense.

True. Charging on administration is disabled if it is disabled in ANY of the relevant places: the patient’s unit, the order’s dispense location, or the medication dispensed. Since the patient’s unit doesn’t allow charging on administration, the system will charge on dispense for all orders for that patient.

1. Review the following configuration:  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637263627032489776.png&ver=1590801903333)  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637263627113437303.png&ver=1590801911427)  
    FUROSEMIDE 10 MG/ML IM SOLN is ordered for a patient in EHS Hospital. Which Charge Table is used?

INJECTION STANDARD.

The charge method in the ERX record is “Injection Standard.” Because the patient is in EHS Model Hospital (and not CHS Hospital), the system skips the first two rows shown and finds a match on the 3rd row shown.

1. True or False: the charge map, charge method, and cost to use for billing must all come from the same “level.”

False. You can, for example, set the charge map in the ERX record, the charge method in an NDC Group record, and the cost to use for billing in an NDC record. If settings in the different levels contradict, the setting from the most specific record is used.

Study Checklist

Make sure you can define the following key terms:

Charge on Administration

Charge on Dispense

Charge table

Charge map

Charge method

Cost to use for billing

Linked Procedure

NDC Group

Make sure you can perform the following tasks:

Configure most medications to trigger a charge.

Make sure you fully understand and can explain the following concepts:

How the system determines to charge on administration or dispense

Why you would want to disable charging on administration for a particular medication, dispense location or unit

How Epic determines which charge table to use for an order

How Epic determines the cost to use for billing for an order

When you would set a charge method in both a NDG and an ERX record

## 13. Creating Panels

### Introduction

Panels allow clinicians to order several orders with one search, therefore making the ordering process more efficient. 

By the End of This Lesson, You Will be Able to…

- Create an “and” linked panel
- Create an “or” linked panel
- Create a “followed-by” linked panel
- Create a single-select panel
- Make order panels available when searching

### Creating Linked Panels

A _panel_ (sometimes referred to as an _order_ _panel_) is a single orderable that expands into multiple individual orders. You can build panels to contain linked orders (orders linked with “or,” “followed by,” or “and” logic), or just a number of orders that are often placed at the same time.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|The Foundation System has a panel for “predniSONE (DELTASONE) oral taper.” It appears as a single orderable in **Place new orders or order sets** field, but expands into a series of prednisone orders linked with “followed by” logic.|

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637268823802089030.png&ver=1591321580183)

Panels are created as records in the SmartGroup (OSQ) master file, the same master file that contains the building blocks of Order Sets. Unlike the SmartGroups used only in Order Sets, panels are configured so that they can be searched for and selected in the **Place new orders or order sets** field of the Orders activity (or when nesting with another OSQ; more on that later).

**TRAINER DEMO**: Your Trainer will order predniSONE (Deltasone) tablet, 20 mg, Oral, Daily, for 3 doses, then click **Link Order** to follow with a copy of the current order, at 15 mg, Oral, Daily, for 3 doses.

- How many clicks would it take for a provider to create the taper pictured above manually? Too many!

Search for "pred taper" and select IP MED PREDNISONE TAPER ORAL off the Database tab (if needed).

- Pre-built panels save ordering providers time and clicks.

Check out the [Medication-Focused Order Sets Badge](https://training.epic.com/CourseCatalog#/?LocationID=1&VersionID=1236&ViewID=train-tracks&Query=order%20sets&TrackID=2247).|

#### Including Panels on the Facility List

The Facility List tab should contain more than just available medications, it should also include panels and non-medication orders.

To include those things on the Facility List, build a separate preference list and manually add panels and non-medication orders to it.

Then, link the preference list to the hospital like you did with the Facility Medications Preference List in Chapter 10.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637286928941160206.png&ver=1593132094000)

Why do you need two Preference List (LPF) records?

Panels are not ERX records, they cannot be added to the central pharmacy medication list.

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Building a Medication Panel with Followed By Logic

Azithromycin (Zithromax) is often prescribed in a “Z-Pak.” Patients take 500 mg on the first day of treatment, then 250 mg daily for the next four days. In an Inpatient setting, you can mimic that dosing with a panel that uses “followed by” logic. Let’s see how.

##### Part 1: Create a “Followed-By” Panel

1. Log in to Classic as your administrator (ADM##/train).
2. Click the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner (or ctrl + space bar) and search for **“SmartGroup”**
3. Create a new record named “TRN3## AZITHROMYCIN (Z-PAK) PANEL”. Accept the initial contact.
4. Go to the **General Info** form.
5. Change the display name from all capital letters to “trn3## azithromycin (Z-Pak) panel”

- Case-sensitive
- The display name appears at the top of the panel when you select it in the Orders activity, and is the default name when you add this panel to a SmartGroup in an Order Set.
- This does _not_ appear on preference lists. When added to a preference list, the display name is blank by default.

1. Select the check box for **Panel (requires this contact to be released)**.

- This tells the system that you are creating a panel of orders for ordering, rather than just a building block of an Order Set.

1. Go to the **Panel Info** form.
2. In the **Link Type** field, enter “Followed by”.
3. In the **Panel type** field, enter “Medication Panel”.

- You can add this to “Meds” type preference lists.
- Users will see this panel when they limit their search to just medications.

1. Go to the **Configuration** form.
2. At the top of the screen, click **Add Item**. Select the Item Type of "Inpatient Order".
3. Search for and select "azithromycin (Zithromax) tablet".
4. In the order composer, enter a dose of "500 mg", a frequency of "Daily", and indicate the order should last for 1 dose.

- Any details you set here, in the panel, will override the default values in the azithromycin tablet ERX record. 
- Any details you do NOT set here will use the default values from the ERX. 

1. At the top of the Order Composer, click **Accept**.
2. Add a second item for "azithromycin (Zithromax) tablet" with these details: 250 mg, Daily, for 4 doses.

- Hint: Click **Add Item** again. Be sure to click **Accept** when done. 

1. Scroll up to see the entire Configuration section. Your panel should look like this:  
      
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637850027802502269.png&ver=1649441980163)

- This panel uses “followed by” linking.
- The top order is first. The second order follows.
- The **Move Up** or **Move Down** buttons allow you to switch the order.

1. At the top of the SmartGroup workspace, click **Release**. Yes, you are sure.

- You must fully release a panel to test it, you can’t just Test Release it.
- If you need to make changes to a released panel, click Version to make a new contact.

1. Close your record.

##### Part 2: Test Your Work

1. Log into Hyperspace as your pharmacist (RX##/train).
2. Open your Kristi patient’s chart.
3. Search for a new order: “trn3## azith”.
4. Find your panel on the **Database** tab (in the Medications section because you gave it a panel type of "Medication Panel").

- Notice that its display name doesn't appear her; you see the ALL CAPS record name. That's expected. 

1. Select and accept your panel.

- It appears in the Orders activity like this (due times may vary):  
    .![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637850028968362894.png&ver=1649442096750)
- Note the **Followed by** linking and the second order starting tomorrow.

1. Click the first order to open the order composer. 
2. Change the **Starting** date of the first order to tomorrow.

- Look at the start time of the second order in the sidebar.
- Will the second order still start tomorrow? No, it is now starting two days from now.

1. Click **Sign & Verify**. Pick an order mode and provider. 

- How can you tell that these orders were placed as part of a panel?   ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638115361460453437.png&ver=1675982546043)
- How can you tell these two orders are linked to each other?  Linked Orders appears in the bottom right, under Other Details. 

1.  Verify the first order, the one for 500 mg.  

- Look at the Rx Sidebar. You still see a stop sign next to this order.
- When verifying linked orders, you have to verify ALL the linked orders before ANY of them are verified. 
- This is true even if the orders did NOT come from a panel, and were manually ordered and linked. 

1. Verify the second order, for the 250 mg tablet. Review the pop-up, and confirm that, yes, you want both orders to be verified. 
2. Go to the MAR and scroll to the bottom. Find the azithromycin orders under the Future Medications section. 

- How can you tell that these two orders are linked? The green bar on the left, with the arrow indicating one order is followed by the other. 

1. Go to the Orders activity. Click **Modify** on the first azithromycin order. Change the Dose to "250 mg".

- Does the dose of the second order change? No!
- The dose of one linked order does NOT affect the doses of other orders. 

1. Change the dose back to 500 mg.
2. Change the start time of this order to "now".

- Next to the Frequency, choose this

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638300280257756973.png&ver=1694467225780)

- Click **Include Now**.
- Look at the second order? What changed? It now starts tomorrow, instead of two days from now. 

1. Click **Cancel** and close the order composer for the panel.
2. Click **Discontinue** for the first azithromycin order.

- The second order will also be discontinued! 

1. Click Sign. Pick an order mode and provider. 

#### Exercise 2: Building a Medication Panel with Or Logic

Famotidine (Pepcid) is a medication used to treat peptic ulcers and acid reflux. Patients who need it often have upset stomachs, so physicians would commonly order it on paper like so: “Pepcid 20 mg IV/PO BID”. The “IV/PO” means it could be given orally or via an IV injection, depending on how well the patient was tolerating oral intake.

A panel makes it easier for users to place such orders.

##### Part 1: Create an “Or” Panel

1. In Classic, create a new SmartGroup named “TRN3## FAMOTIDINE IV/PO PANEL”. Accept the initial contact.

- Hint: Search (Ctrl + Space) for **“SmartGroup”**. Select the **Create** tab. 

1. On the **General Info** form, make the following settings:

- **Display name:** trn3## famotidine (Pepcid) IV or ORAL
- Make it a panel (Hint: check a box!) 

1. On the **Panel Info** form, make the following settings:

- **Link type:** Or
- **Panel type:** Medication Panel

1. On the **Configuration** form, use the **Add Item** button to add the following inpatient orders, in this order:

- famotidine (Pepcid) IV: 20 mg, Intravenous, every 12 hours scheduled  
    _This is an “orderable” and will appear with the name “injection” in the display name after you select it._
- famotidine (Pepcid) tablet: 20 mg, Oral, every 12 hours scheduled  
    _Note that the frequency is already selected, because you selected one in the first order. "Or" linked orders with non-PRN frequencies need to have the same frequency and due times._ 

1. Click **Release** and close your record.

##### Part 2: Test Your Work

1. In Hyperspace as your pharmacist (RX##/train), open Kristi’s chart.
2. Search for a new order: “trn3## famot”.

- Find your panel on the **Database** tab (in the Medications section because you gave it a panel type of "Medication Panel").
- Notice that its display name doesn't appear her; you see the ALL CAPS record name. That's expected.

1. Select and accept your panel.

- It appears in the Orders activity like this (due times may vary):  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638115400489882033.png&ver=1675986448983)
- Note the **Or** linking, and that the two orders are scheduled for the same times.

1. Click on one of the orders the order to open the order composer. 
2. Change the frequency of one order. Change the starting date.

- Does the frequency and starting date of the other order change too? Yes. "Or" linked orders must be due at the same time with the same frequency.

1. Change the frequency back to q12h sch, starting now. 
2. Change the dose of one order. 

- Does the dose of the other order change, too?  No. The doses of linked orders are not kept in sync with each other. 

1. Change the dose back to 20 mg. 
2. Click **Sign & Verify**. Choose an order mode and provider. 
3. Verify both orders. Confirm that you want to verify the linked group.
4. Go to the MAR and find your linked group for famotidine. 
5. Pretend you're the nurse. You decide that Kristi can tolerate the oral famotidine. Click the due time for the tablet.
6. In the **Time** field, enter "n" (for "now"), then click **Accept**. 
7. Review the message about the linked order, and click **Continue Administration**. 

- Back on the MAR, look at the famotidine IVPB order. What happened to the due time that was there? It now says "See Alt" with the same time as the "Given" action for the tablet.
- This is the point of "Or" linked orders: when it's time to administer a dose, the nurse can choose which order to give, and the MAR will mark the other orders as "See Alt" to indicate they do NOT need to be administered. 

1. Go to the Orders activity. Discontinue the famotidine IVPB and click **Sign**.  

- Because this order was part of a panel, it prompts you to consider discontinuing the other order. But you don't need to discontinue them both. 

1. Leave the famotidine tablet order alone. Click **Discontinue Selected Orders**. Pick an order mode and provider. 

#### Exercise 3: Building a Mixed Panel with “And” Logic

“And” linking can connect two medication orders that represent a cohesive therapy. You can also create panels with “and” linking to tie medication orders to non-medication orders. This doesn’t link their schedules in any way, but it does group the orders together in the Orders activity. It can also prompt users to discontinue the entire panel if one order is discontinued.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|When providers order a gentamicin (Garamycin) IV for patients, the often order it with these two lab tests:<br><br>- Gentamicin peak<br>    - Measures the highest amount of gentamicin in the bloodstream, usually drawn right after the 4th dose finishes infusing<br>- Gentamicin trough<br>    - Measures the lowest amount of gentamicin in the blood stream, usually just drawn before the 4th dose begins infusing|

Part 1: Create an "And" Panel

1. In Classic, as your administrator (ADM##/train), create a new panel named “TRN3## GENTAMICIN IV WITH PEAK AND TROUGH”. Accept the initial contact.

- Tip: Search (Ctrl + Space) >> "SmartGroup" >> **Create** tab 

1. Give it a **Display Name** of “trn3## gentamicin (Garamycin) IVPB with peak and trough”
2. Make it a panel.
3. On the **General Info** form, enter this in the **Description** field:  
      
    _Lab collection times are NOT linked to medication due times. If you change the  
    medication's frequency or schedule, adjust the scheduled times of the labs accordingly._   
     
4. Give it a link type of “And” and a panel type of “Mixed Panel”.

- The previous two panels that you built contained medications and had a type of “Medication Panel," which can use any type of linking ("or," "and" or "followed by").
- A panel that contains both medications and non-meds must have a type of “Mixed Panel,” and can only use “and” linking. The other choices are not possible.

1. Add these inpatient orders, using the **Add Item** button: 

- gentamicin (Garamycin) IV: 1 mg/kg, Intravenous, Every 8 hours, offset of 0 minutes  
    _Use frequency 200521; the offset of 0 minutes means the order will be scheduled to start "now" when the panel is selected._ 
- Gentamicin level, trough [LAB26]: Once timed, Offset 23.75 hours, Comments “Collect 15 minutes before the start of the 4th dose of gentamicin IV.”
- Gentamicin level, peak [LAB28]: Once timed, Offset 25 hours, Comments “Collect 30 minutes after the completion of the 4th dose of gentamicin IV.”

1. Click the key icon next to the **gentamycin (Garamycin) IV** order.

- This is now a “keystone” order. If a user discontinues this order, they’ll immediately be prompted to discontinue the other orders in the panel, too.

1. Scroll up to see the entire Configuration form, Confirm that it looks like this:![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638115474527098894.png&ver=1675993852717)
2. **Release** the panel and close your record.  
     

Part 2: Test Your Work

1. Hyperspace, as your pharmacist (RX##/train), open Kristi's chart.
2. Search for a new order: “trn3## gent peak trough”.

- Do NOT just search for "trn3## gent". That will auto-select your eye-drops from the Facility List. 
- Find your panel on the **Database** tab (in the Order Sets & Panels section because you gave it a panel type of "Mixed Panel").
- Notice that its display name doesn't appear here; you see the ALL CAPS record name. That's expected.

1. Select and accept your panel.
2. Close the Order Composer for the trough order. The panel should look like this in the Order Composer (due times will vary):  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638115476477594886.png&ver=1675994047753)

- Note that the collection times for the labs might be a little off. The start time of the IV rounds up to the next 15-minute interval (based on a system-wide setting), but the start times of the labs are offset from "now." That's why we included a comment to clarify when each specimen should be drawn. 

1. Open the order composer for the gentamicin IVPB. Change the **First Dose** of the order to be "n+60" (for 60 minutes from now). 

- Confirm that the scheduled times of the labs did NOT automatically change. The schedules of "And" linked orders are NOT linked to each other. 

1. Change the gentamicin IVPB's **First Dose** to be "n" (now). 
2. Accept the panel. 
3. Click **Sign**. Pick an order mode and provider. 

- If you see an "Autoverification Failed" message, click **Cancel**.  (If you don't see this, don't worry about it.)
- Your panel now appears under the Scheduled section of the active orders.
    - The labs also appear at the bottom, in the Labs section.  

1. Click **Discontinue** for one of the gentamicin LABS.

- Are you prompted to discontinue the other orders in the panel? No.

1. Click **Discontinue** for the gentamicin (Garamycin) IVPB.

- The peak and trough labs are also marked for discontinuation! That’s because the gentamicin IVPB was a keystone order for this panel.

1. Discontinue the whole panel (click **Sign** and pick and order mode and provider). 

#### Exercise 4: Add Your Panels to the Facility List

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|This exercise assumes that you have completed:<br><br>- Chapter 9 >> [Exercise 1: Configuring an ICU Meds Preference List](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=100058163&PrefDocID=126972)|

As you tested your work during the previous exercises, you had to go to the **Database** tab to find your panels. Let's fix that!

Part 1: Create and Build Your Preference List

1. Create a “Panels” Preference List

- Hint: Search >> **Preference List Composer**

1. Name it “TRN3## FACILITY MED PANELS”  
    _(replacing ## with your assigned number)_

- List Type: Orders
- Sub Type: Order Panels
- Ordering Mode: Inpatient

1. Click **New Section**. Name the new section "Order Panels".
2. Add each of these panels that you created earlier. (Hint: click **New Item**, then **Accept & New Item**). For each one, change the **Display Name** field to match the capitalization below (or else they'll appear in ALL CAPs on your Facility List).

- trn3## azithromycin (Z-Pak) panel
- trn3## famotidine (Pepcid) IV or ORAL
- trn3## gentamicin IV with peak and trough

1. Close your preference list.

Part 2: Add One of your Panels to the ICU Meds Preference List

|   |
|---|
||

1. Still in Classic, open your TRN3## ICU MEDS Preference List (LPF) record.

- Hint: Search (Ctrl + Space) >> "Preference List Composer" >> search
- This preference list is already attached to your TRN3## CRITICAL CARE DEPT PROFILE, which is attached to your physician's TRN3## CRITICAL CARE login department.

1. Click **New Section** and name it "Antibiotics".
2. Add your "trn3## gentamicin IV with peak and trough" panel to this new section. (Be sure to update the display name to be lowercase!)
3. Close the record.

Part 3: Link the Preference List to your Hospital

1. In Text, open your hospital record.

- **Path: Text >> Clinical Administration >> Facility Structure >> Locations (EAF)**
- Open your trn3## Hospital and use Home + F9 to search for “Inpatient Facility Preference List”
- If you can't get Home + F9 to work, page down ~70 times.

1. Under Inpatient Facility Preference List, add a type of "Order Panels" and the TRN3## FACILITY MED PANELS list.
2. SHIFT + F7 to exit the record.

Part 4: Test Your Work

1. Go to Hyperspace. Log out, and log in as your physician (MD##/train). Be sure to pick a department of your TRN3## CRITICAL CARE. 
2. Open Kristi's chart from Patient Lists. 
3. In the Orders activity, click the **+New** button.
4. Enter your trn3## in the search field and press Enter. 
5. On the **Preference List** tab, confirm that you see only this:

- trn3## azithromycin (Z-Pak) panel _(in the Medications section)_
- trn3## famotidine (Pepcid) IV or ORAL _(in the Medications section)_
- trn3## gentamicin (Garamycin) ophthalmic solution 0.3% _(your ERX record from chapter 1)_

#### If You Have Time: Document Your Findings

|**Panels**|   |
|---|---|
|Panels are records in the SmartGroup (OSQ) master file—the same type of records that are used to build Order Sets. What must you do to make a SmartGroup a panel, which can be ordered on its own?|Select the **Panel (requires this contact to be released)** check box on the **General Info** form.|
|What is special about verifying orders that are part of a linked group?|None of the individual orders are actually verified until you click **Verify** for all of them.|
|If you change the schedule or frequency of an order in a "Followed-by" linked group, what happens to the schedule of the subsequent order(s)?|Their start times change to reflect the new end time of the order you modified.|
|If you change the schedule or frequency of an order in an "Or" linked group, what happens to the schedule(s) of the other order(s) in the group?|They change as well. If any of the orders in an "Or" linked group has a non-PRN frequency, then ALL orders in that group must have the same frequency and schedule.|
|If you change the schedule or frequency of an order in an "And" linked group, what happens to the schedule(s) of the other order(s) in the group?|Nothing. The schedules of "And" linked orders don't automatically reflect each other.|
|When a nurse administers a medication that is part of an "Or" linked group, what happens to the other orders?|They automatically appear with a "See Alt" action at the same time.|
|What does clicking the "key" icon next to an order in a panel do?|It makes it the keystone order. When someone clicks **Discontinue** for that order, the other orders in the panel are automatically set to be discontinued, too.|

### Creating a Single-Select Panel

Panels can also be used to give clinicians the choice between many similar medications that are not linked to each other.

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637850060663262005.png&ver=1649445266233)

Log in to Hyperspace as your Pharmacist user (RX##) and open Kristi's chart to the Orders activity.

Search for "antibiotic ster" and select "ANTIBIOTIC & STEROID COMBINATION" on the Database tab.

#### Exercise 5: Creating an IV Fluid Panel

The last three exercises explored the effects of adding a link type to a panel. In this exercise, we will not add a link type. Instead, we will configure a **single-select panel**.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|Many organizations use panels to streamline the process for ordering IV fluids. Rather than searching for “Normal Saline” or “D5W” and then skimming through long lists of similar ERX records on a preference list, clinicians search for “IV Fluid” and then order a panel that is an organized list of a variety of fluids with and without additives. They choose one option from the list.|

1. As your administrator in Classic, create a new SmartGroup (OSQ) named “TRN3## IV FLUIDS”. Accept the initial contact.

- Hint: Search (Ctrl + Space) >> "SmartGroup" >> create

1. Give it a **Display Name** of “trn3## Adult IV Maintenance Fluid Options”
2. Make it a panel.
3. Make it single response (Hint: this is a setting on the General Info form)
4. Give it a panel type of “Medication Panel”
5. It should include these inpatient orders:

- sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion [27838]
- dextrose 5 % infusion [2364]
- lactated Ringer's infusion [4318]
- IV fluid builder [200005]

1. **Release** and close your panel.
2. Add this panel to your Facility List:  

- Search (Ctrl + Space) >> "Preference List Composer" >> open TRN3## FACILITY MED PANELS.  
- Select the Order Panel section. Click New Item. Add your trn3## Adult IV Maintenance Fluid Options panel. 
- Set the **Display name** to "trn3## Adult IV Maintenance Fluid Options" (case sensitive); otherwise, the panel will appear in ALL CAPS on your Facility List.
- Close the record.  

1. Back in Hyperspace, in Kristi's chart, order your trn3## Adult IV Maintenance Fluid Options panel from the Facility List tab. This is what you should see:  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637850063191664686.png&ver=1649445519073)  
    _It's okay if you see dollar signs after any of the orders._
2. Remove the order.
3. In Classic, reopen your TRN3## IV FLUIDS SmartGroup panel.
4. Create a new contact for today. (Hint: **Version >> New**)
5. On the configuration form, change the sodium chloride’s default dose to 100 mL/hr.
6. Release the panel and close the record. (Yes, it’s OK. No, we don’t need to review these changes.)
7. Close the SmartGroup editor window.
8. Back in Hyperspace, in Kristi's chart, order your trn3## Adult IV Maintenance Fluid Options panel again. Now, you should see this:  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637850064279536727.png&ver=1649445627867)  
    Notice that defaults set in the SmartGroup appear before any of the medications are selected.
9. Select the sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion. Now, this is what you should see:  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637850064555810357.png&ver=1649445655510)  
    Once selected, defaults that were set in the ERX record also appear. If you don't want to use those defaults, override them in the SmartGroup.
10. Remove the panel order. That’s it, you’re done!

#### Key Takeaways

A panel is a single orderable that expands into multiple individual orders. Panels are SmartGroup (OSQ) records.

**Path: Search >> “SmartGroup”**

##### Panel Settings

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Panel**<br><br>_General Info form_|Enables record to be a panel.<br><br>If unchecked, you cannot access it in the Orders activity.|
|**Display Name**<br><br>_General Info form_|Displays at the top of the panel when selected in the Orders activity or when you add it to an Order Set.<br><br>Does not appear on preference list. Display name is blank by default when added to a preference list.<br><br>Appears on the Database tab in all capital letters.|
|**Link Type**<br><br>_Panel Info form_|Linking logic that should be used for these orders (if any). Link Type choices are:<br><br>- And: For grouping two orders together. This does not automatically schedule them at the same time, but does group them together in the orders activity _(for Mixed Panels and Medication Panels)_<br>- Followed by: For medication orders that should directly follow another. Adjust the schedule of the first med will affect the schedule of subsequent meds _(for Medication Panels only)_<br>- Or: For medication orders that can be administered appropriately in more than one form, depending on what the patient can tolerate. All orders with this link will always have the same due times and frequency as the rest _(for Medication Panels only)_<br><br>You can also leave **Link Type** blank, in which case the orders aren’t linked with any special logic.|
|**Panel Type**<br><br>_Panel Info form_|Indicates the types of orders the panel contains.<br><br>A Mixed Panel contains both meds and procedures.<br><br>If you want to use “Followed by” or “Or” in the **Link Type** field, you must choose “Medication Panel” in this field.|
|**Single Response**<br><br>_General Info form_|Designates the panel as a menu of options that users must choose from. Use this for medication panels that allow a choice between several similar medications.|

To access a panel in the Orders activity, you must **Release** it. If you _test_ _release_ a panel, it can be added to a Smart Set or Order Set, but not ordered on its own.

If you need to make changes after releasing a SmartGroup, click the **Version** button to create a new contact.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|When adding orders to a panel in the real world, select orders from the Facility List. This ensures that the orders are configured and available at the hospital you are configuring for.You have access to the Database tab, but you should be very careful before picking something from the Database. Many of these medications are not configured or safe to put in a panel. If choosing from the Database tab, look for orders that are marked as configured by paying attention to the Configured? column.|

##### How Panels Appear in Search Results

Panels with a type of “Medication Panel” appear in search results with other medications. A “Mixed Panel” appears in the Order Sets & Panels section at the top of the search results.

### Reviewing the Chapter

Review Questions

1. How do you designate a SmartGroup as a panel? Why might you choose to do this?

You select the **Panel (requires this contact to be released)** check box to make an OSQ record a panel. This allows the panel to be ordered on its own.

1. When should you give a panel a type of “Mixed Panel”? What is the effect of using this type?

Use this type for any panel that includes both meds and non-meds. A type of “Mixed Panel” allows a panel to be configured with both medications (ERXs) and procedures (EAPs) as items. The panel will appear in the Order Sets and Panels section of the search window, rather than the Medications section. The example from this chapter is the gentamicin peak and trough.

1. True or False: You can create a Mixed Panel that includes a procedure and a medication using the “Or” link type.

False. A Mixed Panel that includes a procedure and a medication can’t use “Followed By” or “Or” linking, only “And” linking.

1. The ERX record ACETAMINOPHEN 325 MG PO TABS has a default dose of 650 mg. When you add it to a panel along with other analgesics, you do not select a default dose on the Configuration form. When someone orders this panel (and has not yet selected the acetaminophen), will they see “650 mg” below the order name prior to selecting the acetaminophen?

_No, only the defaults that are set in the SmartGroup appear before someone selects a specific medication._

### Requirements

#### Build a Dosed Bulk Medication

In this section you’ll configure a dosed bulk product, TRN3## OFLOXACIN 0.3 % OT SOLN (replacing ## with your assigned number). This record has no Epic configuration. It appears as it would if it were a new, non-configured ERX record from your third-party vendor.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|Use the blank spaces below each configuration requirement to write down what you plan to do in the system. Research shows that writing out complex plans helps your brain to retain learning long term.<br><br>If you view this training companion in Galaxy with the answers visible, the solutions to each problem will appear in those blank spaces.|

Configure your record to appear like this:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637743865889120726.png&ver=1638832988897)

To configure the order name -   
Medication Order Name Text screen, Medication Short Name = trn3## ofloxacin; Medication Brand Name = Floxin; Inpatient Order Name Suffix = otic solution  
Medication Order Name Options Screen, Include Strength in Order Name = Yes; Include Form in Order Name = No  
  
To add default frequency, dose buttons, default dose -  
Inpatient Order Defaults screen, Default Frequency = Daily; Suggest Doses for Order Units = 5, drop, yes; 10, drop, no (or blank)  
  
To remove the rate field -  
Order Composer Configuration screen, Context = Inpatient, Configuration = RX SIMPLE MED  
  
To add route and frequency buttons -  
Inpatient Order Composer Button Selections, Frequency = Daily, 2 times daily; Route = Each Ear, Left Ear, Right Ear

When found on the facility list, the name should be “trn3## ofloxacin (Floxin) otic solution 0.3%”.

On Inpatient Order Defaults screen, set this as the Order Display Name

If you click the magnifying glass for **Route**, you should only see options for “Each Ear,” “Left Ear,” “Otic,” and “Right Ear.”  Note that "Otic" should be available but NOT a button. 

Rx Order Setup screen, Allowed Routes:  list all four; Under Default?:  "No" for all four

If you click the magnifying glass for **Frequency**, all frequencies should be allowed.

Allowed Inpatient Frequencies screen: leave blank

If you manually enter a dose with a fraction of a drop, the **Calculated Dose** should round to the nearest whole number of drops.

Rx Unit Equivalence screen, Medication unit:  "drop"; Administration unit: "drop"; Administration rnd factor:  "1"

The **Dispense code** should be “Bulk.”

Dispense Code Configuration screen, Default Dispense Code: "Bulk"

You stock NDC 24208-410-05, a 5 mL bottle from Bausch Health, in your central pharmacy.

Add your TRN3## OFLOXACIN... ERX to your Central Pharmacy medication list, with this NDC selected. (Be sure to look up your TRN3## OFLOXACIN... ERX record first, and then select the NDC. If you search by NDC, the system will grab the original ERX, not your TRN3## copy).

In the Dispense section of the order composer, **Dispense package** and **Dispense once** should be checked by default.

When adding your ERX to your med list, include a yellow dot. Also, click Edit Medication (to edit your ERX record). On the Packaging form, in Package contains multiple doses (for single patient) field, enter "Yes".

This medication is on formulary for your trn3## Hospital.

Add your TRN3## OFLOXIN... ERX to your TRN3## Formulary medication list. NDCs don't actually matter on the formulary, so select one or don't... either works.

This medication should appear on the facility list.

Should happen automatically when you add your TRN3## OFLOXIN... ERX to your Central Pharmacy Med List (adds it to Facility List). Do NOT clear the green dot next to the ERX.

Every order for this medication should calculate a charge based on the MULTIDOSE BULK charge table.

The Charge Map is configured so that orders with a charge method of "Multidose Bulk," it will use the MULTIDOSE BULK charge table. So: in your TRN3## OFLOXIN... ERX record, set the Default charge method to "Multidose Bulk".

This medication should send charge to the Charge Router. Floxin does not have HCPCS and it is considered self-administrable.

In the Linked Procedure field of the ERX record (in Text or in Classic), enter "HC RX 637 SELF ADMINISTRABLE DRUGS (ALT 250 FOR MEDICARE IP)".  See the charging chapter for details, particularly the section titled "The Linked Procedure."

##### Bonus Challenge

When the user manually enters a single dose of 12 or more drops, the Order Composer _should_ display the following warning:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637743866689734001.png&ver=1638833068950)

To identify the cause of the error, use the screenshot to fill in the following:

- 10 Drop = 1.5     mg

Notice that although we have configured the medication dose in drops, the warning information from the vendor actually uses mg. In order for this warning to appear, the medication (ERX) record must indicate how many drops are in a mg. How can you do this? (Hint: see “Configuring Equivalencies for Units” in chapter 1 of this companion.)

Rx Unit Equivalency screen, bottom left corner, enter:  
    Equiv Qty     Unit  
1. 10                 drop  
2. 1.5                 mg

#### Build a Satellite Pharmacy

You have a new satellite pharmacy in your trn3## Hospital. You are responsible for building it into the system and meeting the requirements below.

The pharmacy’s name is “trn3## 3 South Satellite Pharmacy” (replacing ## with your assigned number).

It stocks only the following ERXs and NDCs:

Create a new medication list record, and add these ERXs. For each, put a check mark next to the NDC shown.

|**ERX**|**NDC**|
|---|---|
|TRN3## OFLOXACIN 0.3 % OT SOLN|24208-410-05|
|TRN3## GENTAMICIN SULFATE 0.3 % OP SOLN|17478-283-10|

Both of the NDCs above should dispense as an entire package.

On the new medication list, give each NDC a yellow dot.

It is open from 0900 to 1700. When it is not open, doses are dispensed from your central pharmacy.

Configure this schedule on the Others form of the satellite Pharmacy (PHR) record.

If the satellite pharmacy is manually closed, the system should suggest your central pharmacy as the covering pharmacy.

Configure this on the General form of the satellite Pharmacy (PHR) record, in the Default covering pharmacy field.

When a bulk medication needs to be dispensed from the satellite, the RX LABEL - BULK SmartText should print at the TRN SATELLITE label printer.

- Remember, since bulk medications dispense only once, there are no cart fills, just first doses and redispenses.
- You can ignore all other types of medications for this lab exercise.

Configure the Label Routing form of the satellite Pharmacy (PHR) record. Add three rows, one for each of these actions:  Dispense (First Dose), PRN Par Dispense (First Dose), and Redispense. In each row: Dispense Code:  Bulk; SmartText:  RX LABEL - BULK, Destination:  TRN SATELLITE

For your patients in your “trn3## 3 North Unit”:

- The system should first consider your floor stock, your ADS cabinet, and your Load to ADS pharmacy (if you built one).
    - Hint: There should be no limitations to what Epic can dispense from the ADS cabinet – you may need to remove some rows and restrictions from an earlier exercise.
- After considering those three locations:
    - All doses of any PRN order for a medication in your trn3## 3 South Satellite Pharmacy should be dispensed from there.
    - For non-PRN orders, the first doses should be dispensed from your trn3## 3 South Satellite Pharmacy if the product is available there. Subsequent (“Cart”) doses should be dispensed from your oncology satellite or central pharmacy.

You should have these rows:  
1) TRN3## 3 North Floor Stock  
2) TRN3## 3 North ADS (A or B is fine)  
3) Load to ADS (optional) >> Limit to Med List = TRN3## LOAD TO ADS MED LIST  
4) TRN3## 3 South Satellite >> First Doses Only  
5) TRN3## 3 South Satellite >> -- >> PRN: Yes  
6) Oncology Satellite  
7) TRN3## Central Pharmacy (optional)

### Testing

Now that your build is done, you can test it out. Follow these steps and evaluate each “CHECK” statement to see if you have met the requirements above.

8. CHECK: You only see allowed route options for “Each Ear,” “Left Ear,” “Otic,” and “Right Ear.”
9. Enter a **Route** of “Right Ear.”
10. Enter a **Dose** of “3.5 drop.”
11. CHECK: You see a warning that says “3.5 drop cannot be administered using available products.”
12. CHECK: The **Calculated Dose** rounds to “4 drop.”
13. CHECK: The **Dispense from** is “trn3## Central Pharmacy” and **First doses from** is “trn3## 3 South Satellite Pharmacy.”
14. CHECK: The **Package** is “5 mL Bottle (24208-410-05).”
15. CHECK: **Dispense package** and **Dispense once** are checked.
16. CHECK: The **Dispense code** is “Bulk.”
17. Enter a **Dose** of “12 drop.”
18. BONUS CHECK (if you did the Bonus Challenge): Warnings appear that the single dose is too high.
19. Change the **Dose** back to “5 drop” and click **Accept**.

Verify and Check Labels

1. Click **Sign & Verify**.
2. Override any warnings.
3. Select telephone with readback, and select Kristi's attending provider.
4. CHECK: The Floxin does NOT have a blue flag warning in Verify Orders, because it is a Formulary medication.
5. On the Floxin, click **Show Charge**.
6. CHECK: A dollar amount should appear.
7. Verify the order.
8. Go to the Medications activity.
9. Highlight the Floxin and click **Label Hx**.

This activity gives you a semi-guided introduction to tools not covered during class. You will not find these tools on the exam, but they are commonly used by customers.

Facilities frequently add and remove drugs from the formulary and inventory. This could be due to formulary changes, new research, or process changes. In Epic, preference lists, medication lists, and other master files must be adjusted when this happens.

In this section, you look at two tools that can help you with this process.

Search for a Medication on Preference Lists

You make medications available to be ordered through preference lists. There are many preference lists in a single hospital. You need a tool for searching for medications on preference lists.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|You have been using TRN3## GENTAMICIN SULFATE 0.3 % OP SOLN in your trn3## Hospital. However, the medication has been removed from the market. Medi-Span has retired the ERX record. You have to stop people from ordering this drug.|

The Advanced Preference List Composer can do this. Here’s how:

1. In Classic, click the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner (ctrl + space bar) and search for **>> Preference List Composer** link.
2. Then, in the lower left corner, click **Advanced**.
3. Enter an **Ordering mode** of Inpatient.
4. In the **Search item** field, enter the ERX record you are trying to find.
5. In the **System, user or frequent orders lists** field enter System Preference List.
6. Click **Search** to search all of the system lists for an ERX record.
7. Once the lists containing that ERX record appear, ctrl-click to highlight the lists you want to change. Use **Add Item**, **Delete Item**, and **Replace Item** to modify these lists.

On all preference lists remove your TRN3## GENTAMICIN SULFATE 0.3 % OP SOLN.

- If you are working in the Practice environment, you will not be able to find the gentamicin. Instead, use trn3## ofloxacin (Floxin) otic solution 0.3%.

Search for a Medication Everywhere

The Advanced Preference List Composer allows you to manipulate multiple preference lists in several ways. However, it only works for preference lists. To find medication lists, order sets, and other records that contain a medication, use the Medication Replacer. The Medication Replacer searches many master files, and allows you to replace one medication with another, or remove a medication.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|Your gentamicin eye drops are no longer on preference lists, but they are still on some medication lists. They could potentially be on order sets, panels, BPAs, and chemo protocols.|

1. In Classic, click the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner (ctrl + space bar) and search for **>> Medication Replacer**.
2. Click **New Search**.
3. In **Original Medication** enter the ERX to search for.
4. Optionally, in **Replacement Medication** enter the ERX which should replace the original medication.
5. Under **Select Master Files To Search** select where you want to look for the original medication.
6. Click **Search**.
7. View the search results to see where the medication is found. For master files editable in Classic, you can click the link to open that record.
8. Then, either deal with each item manually or click **Select Replacements** to continue to use the Medication Replacer to replace the original medication with a replacement medication.

Identify all of the places where your TRN3## GENTAMICIN SULFATE 0.3 % OP SOLN is being used.

- If you are working in the Practice environment, you will not be able to find the gentamicin. Instead, use trn3## ofloxacin (Floxin) otic solution 0.3%.

If you finish this exercise and still have time left in class, feel free to start on your homework chapters or project in your Project environment

## 15. What to Do Before RX405

### Introduction

This chapter discusses how to best prepare for the RX405 class and complete the other requirements as quickly as possible.

At a high level, prioritize the following tasks before you return for your RX405 class:

- Review key topics from this class, RX305.
- Complete the RX100 Willow Inpatient Fundamentals Self-Assessment.
- Complete the RX205 Willow Inpatient User Configuration Self-Assessment (you do not need to take this if you took another equivalent user configuration class)
- If you have time, start working on the Willow Inpatient Administration Project.
- If you still have time, complete the SmartTools Homework chapters from this training companion (RX305).

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|The topics above are list in order of importance. RX405 class assumes that you are proficient with the main tasks and concepts from RX205 and RX305 and Willow Inpatient Fundamentals (RX100), so you should focus on those tasks first.<br><br>While the Willow Inpatient Fundamentals and User Configuration Self-Assessments are not required to be completed before coming to RX405, we recommend completing it before returning to Epic if you’ve got time.<br><br>You might not be able to complete the last four bullets before returning to class. They are _NOT_ required before you attend RX405, but they _ARE_ required for certification or accreditation. If you have time between classes, you can get a head start.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Beyond the Basics](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_beyond_the_basics.png)|_Questions?_<br><br>Many questions about training, projects, and exams, are answered in Epic’s Training Guide for either [community members](https://galaxy.epic.com/?#Browse/page=1!68!280!2904903) or [consultants](https://galaxy.epic.com/?#Browse/page=1!68!280!2904905), which is available from the Training Home of the UserWeb or on Galaxy. You are also welcome to contact your Epic representative with questions.<br><br>For more information about using the Project environments, refer to the [Welcome to Certification Environments](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=100171726&PrefDocID=151854) document in Galaxy.|

### First: Review Key Topics from this Book

For your project and exam, you need to be familiar with the RX305 book, but the RX405 class will rely on your understanding of some topics more than others.

When, Where, and How?

You should complete the following tasks in your **Study** environment.

These environments are refreshed (erased and restored to their original state) every Friday evening. Most of the tasks build on earlier tasks, so you should try to accomplish these in a single work week.

Use your class info sheet from class for the user IDs, TRN3##, and patients in these exercises. If you don’t have your info sheet from class, go the UserWeb and search Galaxy for “Willow Classroom Information Sheet”.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|**_What if My TRN3## Has Been Used?_**<br><br>If you start on these tasks and it appears that the records starting with your TRN3## have already been configured, STOP!<br><br>Pick a different classroom information sheet. We recommend starting with the higher TRN3##s (for example, TRN340), as they are less likely to have been handed out in class.|

Topics to Review Before RX405

The topics are presented in the order you should do them. These tasks build on each other; you need to complete the earlier ones for the later ones to work.

Medication Build

In RX405 class, you will do a _lot_ of Medication (ERX) build. Complete the following to improve your proficiency with building simple ERX records.

- RX305, Chapter 1:
    - Exercise 2: Configure Your Gentamicin Eye Drops
    - If You Have Time: Configure Another Dosed Product

Pharmacy & Medication List Build

In RX405 class, you’ll add a _lot_ of medications and NDCs to your pharmacies’ Medication List (EFY) records. You’ll want to understand what these lists are and how to navigate them as much as possible.

- RX305, Chapter 2:
    - Read “Creating a Central Pharmacy” and “Designating a Pharmacy as the Main Pharmacy.”  
        (For any reading, here and below, also perform the steps in the practice environment.)
    - Exercise 1: Testing Your Central Pharmacy
- RX305, Chapter 3:
    - Read “Adding to a Medication List”

Label Routing

In RX405 class, you’ll spend a fair amount of time updating Label Routing tables. Practice Label Routing by doing the following:

- RX305, Chapter 5:
    - Read “What Kind of Label Prints?”
    - Read “Setting up Label Routing”
    - Exercise 1: Configure Label Printing

The Facility List

When you configure a Medication (ERX) record, you use preference lists to determine who can find it and order it. In RX405, much of what we’ll do relies on your understanding of the Facility List tab and how it is updated.

- RX305, Chapter 9:
    - Read “The Preference List Tabs”
    - _Optional (do this if you think you need practice to understand preference lists and profiles):_ Exercise 1: Configuring an ICU Meds Preference List
- RX305, Chapter 10:
    - Read “Adding Medications to the Facility List” (steps 1-4)

The Formulary

In RX405, you will often be directed to add something to the hospital’s formulary. Do the following to reinforce your understanding of these concepts:

- RX305, Chapter 11:
    - Read “Configuring the Formulary”
    - Exercise 1: Creating Your Hospital Formulary

Charging

In RX405, we’ll repeatedly discuss the importance of assigning the correct charge method and linked procedure to the medications you configure. Do the following to reinforce your understanding of these concepts:

- RX305, Chapter 12:
    - Read “Calculating a Charge” and “Triggering Charging”

Optional: Preview RX405 Training Companion

Some trainees find it helpful to look through the companion for RX405 before attending class. If you would like to do so, go to Galaxy and search for “RX405”. Download the Willow Inpatient Administration II companion PDF to look through

### Second: Complete the RX100 Self-Assessment

You’re going to be asked to absorb a lot of new information when you come back to RX405, and it’ll be easier to do that if you’ve already completed the material from RX100. You’ll also be able to complete your certification or accreditation more quickly after taking RX405 than if you wait until after all your classes to finish RX100.

You aren’t _required_ to complete the self-assessment before you return to RX405. Find more information about the RX100 Self-Assessment in RX100, Appendix A.

### Third: Complete the RX205 Self-Assessment

You’re going to be asked to absorb a lot of new information when you come back to RX405, and it’ll be easier to do that if you’ve already completed the material from RX205 You’ll also be able to complete your certification or accreditation more quickly after taking RX405 than if you wait until after all your classes to finish RX205.

You aren’t _required_ to complete the self-assessment before you return to RX405. Find more information about the RX205 Self-Assessment in RX205, Appendix A.

### If Time: Start Your Project

You can start working on your project now. The project is quite large; it generally takes 30 - 80 hours to complete, test, and troubleshoot it. If you start now, you’ll both reinforce material from RX205 and RX305 and be in a better position to finish the project after you attend RX405 and complete the homework chapters.

The instructions to begin the project are in appendix A; the steps will guide you on how to get a link to the project specifications. Once you download the project specifications, the first half covers the material you learned in RX205 and RX305 and do not include anything from RX405. Material from RX405 is found after in the second half.

### If Time: Start on Homework Chapter

This training companion contains a homework chapter - Homework: Configuring SmartTools. This homework chapter is required for certification or accreditation but is not necessary before RX405.

Information from the homework chapter will be applicable to your project and is considered a testable objective.

Instructions for how to complete the homework is found in the homework chapter.

4. Do the exercises in this chapter in your **Study** environment.

- The Study environments are refreshed on Friday evenings (Central time zone). Complete your work before that time, or you will need to start over. 

1. Review the study checklist at the end of this chapter.

Altogether, expect the e-learnings and exercises in this chapter to take about 1.5 hours to complete.

#### Hyperspace and Classic

**Hyperspace** is Epic’s front-end user interface. It’s what most users think of as “Epic” and what you used in your Fundamentals class.  End users log in to Hyperspace to complete their workflows and do their jobs. Administrators and builders also log in to Hyperspace to test and troubleshoot build.

The **Classic client** is used if you need to build, configure records, or use utilities (you may also use Text, but that won't be needed for this chapter). Some admin activities are already available in Hyperspace, and more will be migrated over time. However, it’s not worth memorizing which activities are in Hyperspace and which ones must be accessed via Classic.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|- **Build in Classic.** Many admin activities are not available in Hyperspace.<br>- **Test in Hyperspace.** Some end-user activities behave differently in Classic, and Hyperspace is what your users _use._|

Open a new browser tab and go to Epic Access:

- Most learners: Go to [access.epic.com](https://access.epic.com/Citrix/XenApp7-VeronaWeb/).
- If you selected a country in Europe or the Middle East, go to [EUaccess.epic.com](http://euaccess.epic.com/Citrix/XenApp7-AmsterdamWeb/).
    - If you recently requested access, wait 15 minutes until your access request has processed, then log in.

Log in, using the same credentials you use to log in to the UserWeb.

- If prompted, provide your 6-digit authentication code. (If you haven't configured multi-factor authentication, click the [Learn More](https://userweb.epic.com/MFA/LearnMore) link.)
- You might be prompted to log in again; use the same credentials you use for the UserWeb.
- You have completed this step when the site displays "Home" and "Apps" at the top of the page.

|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|Complete the e-learning lessons listed in the previous section prior to starting these exercises!<br><br>Perform the following exercises in your **Study** environment. Keep in mind, that environment refreshes on Friday evening. Plan your work accordingly.|

##### Exercise 1 – Build a Renal Dose Adjustment SmartText

In this exercise, you will build a SmartText for pharmacists to use when adjusting the dose for medications that depend on renal function. The SmartText will include two SmartLists, which you will build first. You will then compose the SmartText to include your lists and a number of SmartLinks. When you are finished, it should appear to users by default like this:

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637985872537597373.png&ver=1663026453747)

##### Build a Renal Dosing Medications SmartList

1. Log in to Classic as user RXADM (password: epic).
2. Under the Log Out button near the top right, click the magnifying glass to search for **SmartList**.
3. Create a new SYSTEM SmartList named “XYZ Renal Dosing Meds” (_case sensitive, replacing XYZ with your initials_).

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638118951452491759.png&ver=1676341545257)

1. Make sure **Released** is checked on the right side bar.

- This should be checked by default. If you accidentally uncheck it, you will not be able to find your SmartList when it’s time to build your SmartText!

1. Pharmacists might be writing this note about more than one medication. Choose Multiple for the Selection Type.
2. If more than one medication is selected, it should say “and” between them. Make sure the correct **Connection Logic** is specified.
3. In the **Choice** section, enter the following medications, one in each row. (This list is limited for the purposes of this exercise.) Remember, selections appear exactly as you type them, in the order that you type them. Always check spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.

- ampicillin
- ceFAZolin
- cetirizine
- enoxaparin
- famotidine
- levofloxacin
- moxifloxacin
- piperacillin
- traMADol
- vancomycin
- ***

1. None of these medications should be marked as the default.
2. This list should be Reselectable, allowing your pharmacists to refresh the SmartList if they make a mistake. Leave that choice selected.
3. Click **Save**.

##### Build an Increased/Decreased SmartList – Less Guided

1. Create a new system SmartList called “XYZ increased/decreased” (_case sensitive, replacing XYZ with your three initials_).

- Hint: on the bottom left corner, click **Open**.

1. Make sure that pharmacists can only pick one of the selections.

- Hint: Check the **Selection Type** section.

1. There should only be two choices, with no default selection:

- increased
- decreased

1. When you are done, save your SmartList.

##### Build a Renal Dose Adjustment SmartText

1. Under the Log Out button, search for **“SmartText”**.

- Alternately, near the top left of your SmartTools activity. click SmartTexts and select the Create tab.

1. Create a new SmartText named “XYZ Renal Dose Adjustment” (_replacing XYZ with your three initials_). 
2. **Accept** the first contact.
3. Before moving on, release this SmartText (Hint: box near the bottom).
4. Next, let’s take care of the Restrictions tab. There are many functional types, but a few are more common for Willow:

- _IP Charting_ – this allows your SmartText to be used across the chart for a patient in the hospital, including the Notes activity
- _Rx Intervention_ – this allows your SmartText to be used within the documentation and scratch notes sections of an i-Vent
- _MR Medication Administration Instructions_ – this allows your SmartText to be used across the medical record in the Administration Instructions field, including inpatient and outpatient encounters.
- _MR Alternatives_ – this allows your SmartText to be used in Alternatives, windows that appear to clinicians to suggest other medications or procedures.
- Hint: This SmartText will be used in both Notes and i-Vents. Add the correct Functional Type(s).

1. Back on the General tab, compose your SmartText display text. Use the hints that follow to add the SmartLinks and SmartLists correctly. When you are finished, it should look something like this:  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637989205754035867.png&ver=1663359775397)

- Hint: To add a SmartLink, use a dot (.) followed by the name of the SmartLink.
    - As you enter each of these SmartLinks, it will change to show “@” on either side (e.g. “@NAME@”). This is how the system recognizes a SmartLink inside a SmartText.
- Use the following SmartLinks for this SmartText:
    - Name
    - Age
    - Sex
    - GFRCG _(calculates the estimated Creatinine Clearance)_
    - Me _(pulls in the name of the clinician writing the note)_
- Hint: To add your SmartLists, place your cursor in the correct place of the display text, then use the Insert SmartList section to find and add it.  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637272099642470210.png&ver=1591649164210)
- Hint: Do not type brackets, name, and ID for your SmartLists! You must use the **Insert SmartList** field.
- Hint: Punctuation, spacing, and capitalization matter! It will appear to clinicians exactly as you type it here.

1. Make sure your SmartText is released and save.
2. Close the SmartTools workspace.
3. Go on to the next section.

##### Exercise 2: Test Your Work

1. To test your work, you’ll need to add a CrCl result to Wayne. Log in to CLASSIC (not Hyperspace) and open your Wayne patient’s chart.

- Hint: Click **Orders** next to the Epic button.
- Don't know who your Wayne patient is? Select any last name from the [RX100 Classroom Information Sheets](https://galaxy.epic.com/Search/GetFile?Url=1!68!100!100025980), which can be found in Galaxy. 

1. On the Activity toolbar, click ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637287726403325858.png&ver=1593211840333) and select **Enter/Edit Results.**
2. Near the top of Enter/Edit Results, click ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image638222509880851613.png&ver=1686690188100).
3. In **Additional test**, enter “LAB383” (Creatinine, Serum) and click **Create Results.**
4. At the bottom of the screen, enter a **Collection Date** of “t” and a **Collection Time** of “n”.
5. On the Components tab near the bottom, find the **Value** column and enter “0.8”.
6. Click **Accept**.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|This result will only generate a CrCl value for 48 hours. If you open Wayne’s chart in >48 hours, repeat these steps.|

1. Log in to Hyperspace and open your Wayne patient's chart. 
2. Using the Notes activity, create a New Note.
3. Find the **Insert SmartText** field and search for your XYZ Renal Dose Adjustment (_replacing XYZ with your initials_).
4. Compare what you see to the screenshot at the beginning of this exercise.
5. Now test your SmartLists. Your list of meds should:

- Include 10 medications and a wildcard (***)
- Have no meds selected by default
- Allow you to select more than one; if you do select more than one, they medications are connected by the word “and”

1. Your increased/decreased list should:

- Have only two choices, with no choice selected by default
- Only allow you to select one

1. Discard the note when you finish testing.

##### If You Have Time: Build a Pain SmartText

Use what you have learned to create another SmartText. This exercise will be less-guided and includes an “embedded” SmartList. If you do not recall how to embed a SmartList, review the e-learning and workbook you completed earlier.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![Example](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_example.png)|Your hospital has decided to involve pharmacists for patients who currently have or have used controlled analgesics for pain management. To make this simpler, they have asked you to design a SmartText for documenting a progress note after rounding on a patient.|

1. Log in to Classic and create a SmartList named “XYZ Controlled Analgesics” (_replacing XYZ with your initials_). This SmartList should:

- Be multiple select, using “And” connections logic
- Include these selections (this list is limited for the purposes of this exercise):
- acetaminophen codeine
- fentaNYL
- HYDROcodone
- HYDROmorphone
- morphine
- oxyCODONE
- ***

1. Create another SmartList named “XYZ Pain Control” (_replacing XYZ with your initials_). This SmartList should:

- Be single select
- Include your XYZ Controlled Analgesics SmartList embedded into the third and fourth selections
- Include these selections:
- The patient is not currently experiencing pain.
- Pain is controlled without medication.
- Pain is controlled with current medications: {XYZ Controlled Analgesics}
- Pain is not well controlled with current medications: {XYZ Controlled Analgesics}

1. Compose your XYZ Pain Control SmartText. It should:

- Include SmartLinks:
- Name
- Age
- Sex
- Me
- Include your XYZ Pain Control SmartList (with your XYZ Controlled Analgesics embedded)
- Be available when writing inpatient notes.
- Appear like this in a note:  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637985874467047385.png&ver=1663026646693)

- When the third or fourth selection is chosen from the Pain Control list, you should see something like the following and have the ability to choose more than one medication:  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637985874730342463.png&ver=1663026673023)

1. Log in to Hyperspace and test your work on your Wayne patient:

- Open his chart and go the Notes activity.
- Start writing a new Progress Note.
- Look up and apply your XYZ Pain Control SmartText.
- Confirm that it appears as shown in the first screen shot above.
- Use F2 to fill out the wildcards and test your SmartList. Confirm that the list appears as shown in the second screen shot above.

#### Reviewing the Chapter

Review Questions

1. Which SmartTool can be used to create a template that includes other SmartTools?

A SmartText is a template that can contain SmartLinks, SmartLists, and wild cards.

1. What is the purpose of a Functional Type?

The functional type in a SmartText determines the purpose, the type of formatting allowed, and which SmartLinks can be used. It is required.

1. True or False: It's important to release SmartList and SmartTexts.

True; you will not be able to use a SmartList or SmartText until it is released.

The best way for you to learn an application is to practice in the system. As you do this, both your knowledge of the system and your comfort increase. After doing general practice based on your per-chapter studies, use the project as a way to self-assess your comprehension.

We strongly recommend that you do this project before attempting the Willow Inpatient Administration Exam. You need an 85% or better to pass the project, but we strongly recommend aiming for 95% to best understand the material.

### Where Should I Start?

Read on to learn about key resources to help you complete your project.

#### How to Request Access to Epic's Cert Environments

Epic's cert environments allow you to complete projects and study. Using the steps below, you can request access to these environments. If you already have access, you'll be able to confirm that access during the request steps.

There might be some additional setup you have to do in order to access a cert environment. For example, you may need to work with your IT team to confirm you have the current version of Citrix installed. For a full overview of this process, view the [**EA001 Using Epic Access**](https://welearning.epic.com/Details.aspx?id=24111) e-learning lesson or review the [Welcome to Certification Environments](https://galaxy.epic.com/Redirect.aspx?DocumentID=100171726&PrefDocID=151854) document on Galaxy.

Below are the basic steps to obtain access to a Study and/or Project environment.

1. Go to the [Training Home](https://training.epic.com/) on the UserWeb.
    - Epic employees: Go to step 4. You do not need to request these environments.
2. Under the Certificate Resources section, select Cert Environment Request.   
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=Snag_34a32479638481006503773690.png&ver=1712539850380)

- You can see any environments currently assigned to you.
- You can request new Study and/or Project environments.
    - NOTE: You will only be assigned one environment per version.  
        ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=envrequestform637865909386518893.png)

1. Once you submit your request, close your web browser.
2. Open a new browser tab and go to Epic Access:
    - Most learners: Go to [access.epic.com](https://access.epic.com/Citrix/XenApp7-VeronaWeb/).
    - If you selected a country in Europe or the Middle East: Wait 15 minutes; then go to [EUaccess.epic.com](http://euaccess.epic.com/Citrix/XenApp7-AmsterdamWeb/).
        - The system takes up to 15 minutes to process access requests for Europe or the Middle East.
3. Log in, using the same credentials you use to log in to the UserWeb.
    - If prompted, provide your 6-digit authentication code. (If you haven't configured multi-factor authentication, click the [Learn More](https://userweb.epic.com/MFA/LearnMore) link.)
    - You might be prompted to log in again; use the same credentials you use for the UserWeb.
    - You have completed this step when the site displays "Home" and "Apps" at the top of the page.
4. Consider using the **Check Your Setup** option before you start using cert environments. This will confirm if your device meets all the requirements.
5. Click the icon to launch the corresponding application.
    - Use **Study** icons for self-study or after-class practice.
    - Use **Project** icons for projects or when explicitly told to use Project environments.
    - Use **Virtual Training** icons only during virtual classes, or when explicitly told to use them.
    - If your training materials instruct you to find an icon you don't see, use the search field to find it. To add the icon to the Home screen, click the star in the icon.

|![Critical](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=u:\production\online%20publisher\images\train_critical.png)|Before you generate your starting records…<br><br>Following the steps below will generate some records for you, but you will also create records throughout the project. You should name all of these records with your initials, so they are easier to identify.<br><br>Use 3 initials to avoid conflicts with other trainees. If you don’t have a middle initial, make one up. Do NOT use numbers as your initials.|

In order to complete your project, you need the project specification and a hospital, unit, virtual department representing your pharmacy, and three patients admitted in your unit. Complete the following steps to have the system create these records for you automatically. You will also be emailed the project specification after you complete these steps:

1. Most Epic Customers, Consultants, and Epic staff:

- Go to access.epic.com.
- Go on to step 3.

1. If you are working from Europe or the Middle East:

- Go to euaccess.epic.com.
- Go on to step 3.

1. Log in, using the same credentials you use to log in to the UserWeb.

- If prompted, provide your 6-digit authentication code. (If you haven't configured multi-factor authentication, click the [Learn More](https://userweb.epic.com/MFA/LearnMore) link.)
- You might be prompted to log in again; use the same credentials you use for the UserWeb.

1. Click the **Project <version>** **Training Magic** icon.
2. If asked to sign in, enter your UserWeb username and password (this is the same login information as you use for access.epic.com).
3. In the **Application** field, choose “Willow.”
4. In the **Project** field, choose “BEGIN Willow IP Admin Project”

- If you cannot find this Project in the list of choices, then we have switched to a newer version and you should request access to that newer version at training.epic.com >> Certification Environment Request.

1. In the **Initials** field, enter the three letters you will use as a prefix for your project. (Enter any 3 letters, they don’t have to be your initials.)
    - If you receive a notification that the initials you entered have already been used by another trainee, please choose a different set of initials. 
2. Click **Next**.
3. Check your email. (If you don’t see it within a few minutes, check your junk mail folder.) The project specifications are linked in that email. If you'd like, print out the project specification.
4. Also in the e-mail, you see something like the below screenshot. Add the IDs to the Project Worksheet included in the project specification.  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637272107268257334.png&ver=1591649926773)

What just happened? The system created the following records for you:

- A hospital (“XYZ Hospital”)
- A virtual Department (DEP) record representing your hospital’s central pharmacy (“XYZ PHARMACY”).
- A nursing unit (“XYZ ICU”) with two rooms (“XYZ-101” and “XYZ-123”) and three test patients:
    - Jack Xyz (a 9-year-old male admitted to your ICU, in room 101).
    - Jill Xyz (a 30-year-old female admitted to your ICU, in room 123).
    - Jeb Xyz (an 80-year-old male admitted to your ICU, in room 123).

Throughout the rest of the project, you’ll need to edit or otherwise make use of these records. You may now begin your project.

If you have questions about these steps or completing the project, e-mail [WillowTrainingSubmission@epic.com](mailto:WillowTrainingSubmission@epic.com).

#### Send Helpful Details in Your Email

The email address above sends emails to a queue which is monitored by a member of the application's training team each day, meaning it is a more efficient way to get your questions answered compared to trying to find a single person to email. When sending an email, it is helpful if you can provide some additional information right away:

- What companion, chapter, and page(s) you are referencing
- If you are asking about something you see in the system, include the following:
    - The name of the environment you are working in (for example: Project Feb, Study Feb D)
    - Companion or task name, section header, page number, and step
    - The User ID you are logged in as
    - The patient name or MRN, if applicable
    - Any configuration you did that the trainer may need to look up
    - What troubleshooting you previously tried that didn't give you the intended results

## Appendix B: Morning Reviews

### Review of Chapters 1-4

1. You need to configure an ERX record for a newly approved knowledge-enhancing inhaler, Trainex. You configure the short name, brand name, and suffix in the TRAINEX 375 MCG MCG/ACT IN AERS record. But when you order it, the Order Name is “Phantasidose 375 MCG/ACT aerosol solution” and none of your defaults or buttons appear.  
      
    What did you do wrong?

You configured the brand name record (Trainex), not the dispensable product (PHANtasidose).

1. You address the problem above and finish configuring the new ERX record. The Order Name for your record appears like this in Hyperspace:  
      
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637279817605230072.png&ver=1592420960423)  
      
    Based on what you see in the screenshot, fill in the most likely values (if any) of these fields:

- Medication short name: PHANtasidose
- Medication brand name: Trainex                 
- Inpatient order name suffix: inhaler               
- Include form in order name? NO! This should always be No.  
     

1. Almost everything looks good for your Trainex inhaler, but on the Order Composer there is still a **Rate** field, and the **Dose** field is only recommended (it should be required).  
      
    What have you forgotten to do? How should you fix it?

You haven’t attached an OCC to the ERX record, so the system is getting display items (including Rate) and Item Control (where dose is only recommended) from the system-wide OCC. To fix that, attach an OCC to the ERX record. Probably use the “Rx Simple Med” OCC.

1. You **Sign & Verify** your order. In Verify Orders, it looks like this by default:  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637638571368919021.png&ver=1628296336880)

Part 1) Your test patient’s unit is NOT currently served by any pharmacies. So, what setting caused it to choose TRN301 CENTRAL PHARMACY as the dispense location?

In Rx Admin >> Hospital/Clinic Admin, the **Main pharmacy** field.

  
Part 2) Notice the stop sign under the Dispense field, which means this order can’t be verified. Which of the following will correct that? (Choose ONE.)

A. Add PHANTASIDOSE 375 MCG/ACT IN AERS to the central pharmacy’s med list

B. Select an NDC for PHANTASIDOSE 375 MCG/ACT IN AERS on the central pharmacy’s med list

C. Put a yellow dot under the P column for the 6.7 g inhaler on the central pharmacy’s med list

D. Configure the PHANTASIDOSE 375 375 MCG/ACT IN AERS med record to have a Dispense Unit of “puff”

Answer: C. The system selected a package (6.7 g inhaler) by default, so both A and B have already happened. The problem is that this is a bulk product, but you haven’t told the system to dispense the entire package. That’s what the yellow dot under the P column does. D is wrong because you don’t dispense puffs.  
  
You’d _also_ want to set the ERX record up to say Package Contains Multiple Doses=Yes.

1. Review the schedule for this Unit Dose cart, and use the information to answer the following questions.  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637922919986662187.png&ver=1656731198660)  
     

You sign and verify an order for amoxicillin capsules (a Unit Dose med) for a patient served by this cart on Tuesday at 1930. The frequency is Every 8 Hours, starting now. So, doses are at 1930, 0330, 1130, etc.

Part 1) How many dispense actions will appear in Order Hx when the order is verified?

4 x Dispense (First Dose) actions; the orders are entered & verified at 1930. That’s _after_ the finalize time (at 1800). So, the 1930 dose is a first dose, as well as the 0330, 1130, and 1930 doses that _would_ be included on the Tuesday cart. 

Part 2) When the cart finalized on Tuesday, how many new dispense actions appeared in Order Hx for the amoxicillin order? 

When the cart finalized on Tuesday at 1800 (for the Tues 2000 to Wed 1959 interval), there were zero new dispense actions in Order Hx. The order had not yet been verified, so it couldn't be dispensed at that time. That's why the doses in that interval were first doses (in part 1). 

Part 3) When the cart starts on Wednesday, how many new dispense actions will appear in Order Hx for the amoxicillin order (assuming it's still active)? 

When the cart starts on Wednesday at 1500 (for the Wed 2000 to Thurs 1959 interval), there will be 3 new Dispense (Pending) actions in Order Hx to account for the doses due on Thursday at 0330, 1130, and 1930. When the cart finalizes on Wednesday at 1800, those Dispense (Pending) actions will become Dispense (Cart Fill) actions.

### Review of Chapters 5-9

1. A pharmacist clicks Verify for an order with a Unit Dose dispense code that will dispense from Central Pharmacy. The system calculates that there are 3 first dose dispenses. Based on the Label Routing table from the Central Pharmacy (PHR) record (see image), what will print when the pharmacist clicks Verify? (Assume that first doses of unit dose meds are NOT going to the Dispense Queue.)  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637947045377938365.png&ver=1659143737797)  
    A. One "RX LABEL - BULK" label  
    B. Three "RX LABEL - BULK" labels  
    C. One "RX LABEL - UNIT DOSE" label  
    D. Three "RX LABEL - UNIT DOSE" labels  
    E. One "RX LABEL - PRODUCTION" label and one "RX LABEL - UNIT DOSE" label  
    F. No labels will print when the pharmacist clicks Verify

Answer: C. One "RX LABEL - UNIT DOSE" label will print. There is one row for the Unit Dose dispense code with an of action Dispense (First Dose); only one label will print because the Group? column says Yes.

1. True/False: You'd like Cart Fill labels to appear in the Dispense Queue. This is configured in the Cart (CRT) record. 

True! Select the **Queue dispenses** checkbox on the Reporting form. First Dose and Redispense labels can be sent to the queue by editing the Dispense Queue form in the Pharmacy (PHR) record.

1. Use this Unit dispense logic to answer the following questions.  
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637279821875059922.png&ver=1592421387407)  
    Part 1) DIPHENHYDRAMINE 25 MG CAPS are loaded in the ADS cabinet, but are not on the Floor Stock med list. It is not a scheduled med. You order it with a frequency of Q6H PRN for allergies. Where will the first doses come from? Where will the subsequent doses come from?

ADS then central pharmacy

Part 2) OXYCODONE-ACETAMINOPHEN 7.5-500 MG PO TABS are loaded in the ADS cabinet, but are not the Floor stock med list. It’s a C-II scheduled med. You order it with a frequency of Q12H. Where will the first doses come from? Where will the subsequent doses come from?

ADS for both (using line 3 of the table)

1. When configuring an ADS cabinet pharmacy (PHR) record, you should enter a dispensing cabinet identifier on the ADS Settings form. Which interface message(s) will fail if this identifier is not correct or missing? Choose ALL that apply.  
    A. Load/Unload message  
    B. Order Dispense message  
    C. Order Verified message

Answer: A and B. The incoming message, Load/Unload and Order Dispense both rely upon the identifier to map the ADS system cabinet ID to the cabinet's pharmacy (PHR) record in Epic.  

1. You have one ADS cabinet on the Med Surg unit. There’s no floor stock and no satellite pharmacy. Nurses should be directed to get medications from the ADS cabinet if it's there. If the med isn’t in the ADS cabinet, but it’s a med that _should_ be loaded into the ADS, the dispense location should be “Load to ADS.”  
      
    Describe how you would configure your records to make dispense logic work as described above.

Create a Load to ADS Pharmacy (PHR) with the Central Pharmacy (EFY) Med List attached. Create an ADS Load Med List (EFY) of all medications that should dispense from the ADS cabinet. In Dispense Logic for this unit, add the Load to ADS Pharmacy after the ADS cabinet row, and enter the ADS Load Med List (EFY) in the Limit to Medication List column.

1. ICU providers are requesting that a new medication be added to their preference list for easy ordering. Which record should you edit to make this change? (Choose ONE.)  
      
    A. The Central Pharmacy Medication List (EFY)  
    B. The ICU Satellite Pharmacy Medication List (EFY)  
    C. The ICU department-level Profile (LPR)  
    D. The ICU Preference List (LPF)  
    E. System Definitions 

Answer: D. The ICU Preference List - the options available on the providers preference list tab are on a Preference List (LPF) already attached to their Profile (LPR). New medications can be added with no additional changes necessary.

### Review of Chapters 10-13

1. You get a call from a pharmacist who was entering orders and noticed that she can order potassium chloride 2 mEq/mL IV solution directly from her facility list. “This would KILL someone,” she says. She’s right! It should never be ordered on its own, though you need it to build mixtures. How can you fix this?

Remove from list by removing green dot - will stay on Formulary

1. When searching for orders, the Facility List tab displays everything that is orderable at the patient's location. What is the right way for you, a Willow analyst, to make that happen?  

First create a Facility List Preference List (LPF) record in the Preference List Composer. Then open the Central Pharmacy Medication List (EFY) for that patient's hospital and link the preference list. Finally, open the Hospital (EAF) record in Text and attach the Facility List Preference List there with a type of Medications. 

1. Match each of these lists to all of the accurate descriptions found below.

|**List**|**Descriptions**|
|---|---|
|Central Pharmacy Med List|A. An EFY record  <br>F. Import spreadsheet-made  <br>I. Every available med  <br>J. Linked to the Central Pharmacy|
|Formulary|A. An EFY record  <br>C. All approved meds  <br>D. A copy of the Central Pharmacy EFY  <br>E. Linked to the Hospital (in Classic)|
|Facility List|B. An LPF record  <br>E. Linked to the Hospital (in Text)  <br>G. Linked to the Central Pharmacy EFY  <br>H. Everything orderable by MDs|

**Descriptions:**

A. An EFY record

B. An LPF record

C. All approved meds

D. A copy of the Central Pharmacy Med List

E. Linked to the Hospital (Location)

F.  Originally made via import spreadsheet

G. Linked to the Central Pharmacy Med List

H. Everything orderable by MDs

I.  Every available med

J. Linked to the Central Pharmacy

1. An order was placed for gentamicin (Garamycin) 0.3 % ophthalmic solution. In Verify Orders, you can see that the charge is calculating (see first image). However, after verification, you see an error in Order History (see second image). 

![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637947076492122582.png&ver=1659146849197)  
![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637947076598062313.png&ver=1659146859807)  
True or False: You can fix this problem by entering a Charge Method in the medication (ERX) record. 

False. You can tell that there is already a Charge Method because the charge is successfully calculating! Since we know the charge is calculating, this error in Order Hx indicates that the charge information could not be sent to the Charge Router; to fix this, add a Linked Procedure to the medication (ERX) record. 

1. Review the screenshot of an order panel.   
    True or False: Changing the dose of the cefTRIAXone (Rocephin) IVPB will also change the dose of the azithromycin (Zithromax) IVPB.   
    ![](https://galaxy.epic.com/Handler/ImageHandler.ashx?filename=image637947095589454988.png&ver=1659148758940)

False. In an "And" linked order panel, the doses are independent of one another.
